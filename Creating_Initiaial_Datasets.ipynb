      "Helmer. Helmer. There, there, of course I was only joking.\n",

      "against your wishes.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. No, I am sure of that; besides, you gave me your word-- (Going\n",

      "Nora. Nora. It's wonderful!\n",

      "beforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight,\n",
      "making ornaments for the Christmas Tree, and all the other fine things\n",
      "that were to be a surprise to us. It was the dullest three weeks I ever\n",

      "cat's going in and tearing everything to pieces?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Of course you couldn't, poor little girl. You had the best of\n",
      "intentions to please us all, and that's the main thing. But it is a good\n",
      "thing that our hard times are over.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, it is really wonderful.\n",

      "As soon as Christmas is over--(A bell rings in the hall.) There's the\n",
      "bell. (She tidies the room a little.) There's some one at the door. What\n",
      "a nuisance!\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. If it is a caller, remember I am not at home.\n",
      "Maid Maid (in the doorway). A lady to see you, ma'am,--a stranger.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Ask her to come in.\n",
      "Maid Maid (to HELMER). The doctor came at the same time, sir.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Did he go straight into my room?\n",
      "Maid. Maid. Yes, sir.\n",

      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, I have indeed. In nine, ten long years--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Is it so long since we met? I suppose it is. The last eight years\n",
      "have been a happy time for me, I can tell you. And so now you have come\n",

      "plucky of you.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I arrived by steamer this morning.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. To have some fun at Christmas-time, of course. How delightful! We\n",
      "will have such fun together! But take off your things. You are not cold,\n",
      "I hope. (Helps her.) Now we will sit down by the stove, and be cosy.\n",
      "No, take this armchair; I will sit here in the rocking-chair. (Takes\n",
      "her hands.) Now you look like your old self again; it was only the first\n",
      "moment--You are a little paler, Christine, and perhaps a little thinner.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. And much, much older, Nora.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Perhaps a little older; very, very little; certainly not much.\n",
      "(Stops suddenly and speaks seriously.) What a thoughtless creature I am,\n",
      "chattering away like this. My poor, dear Christine, do forgive me.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. What do you mean, Nora?\n",
      "Nora Nora (gently). Poor Christine, you are a widow.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes; it is three years ago now.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, I knew; I saw it in the papers. I assure you, Christine, I\n",
      "meant ever so often to write to you at the time, but I always put it off\n",
      "and something always prevented me.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I quite understand, dear.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It was very bad of me, Christine. Poor thing, how you must have\n",
      "suffered. And he left you nothing?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And no children?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Nothing at all, then.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Not even any sorrow or grief to live upon.\n",
      "Nora Nora (looking incredulously at her). But, Christine, is that possible?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (smiles sadly and strokes her hair). It sometimes happens,\n",
      "Nora.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. So you are quite alone. How dreadfully sad that must be. I have\n",
      "three lovely children. You can't see them just now, for they are out\n",
      "with their nurse. But now you must tell me all about it.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No, no; I want to hear about you.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, you must begin. I mustn't be selfish today; today I must only\n",
      "think of your affairs. But there is one thing I must tell you. Do you\n",
      "know we have just had a great piece of good luck?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No, what is it?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Just fancy, my husband has been made manager of the Bank!\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Your husband? What good luck!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, tremendous! A barrister's profession is such an uncertain\n",
      "thing, especially if he won't undertake unsavoury cases; and naturally\n",
      "Torvald has never been willing to do that, and I quite agree with him.\n",
      "You may imagine how pleased we are! He is to take up his work in the\n",
      "Bank at the New Year, and then he will have a big salary and lots of\n",
      "commissions. For the future we can live quite differently--we can do\n",
      "just as we like. I feel so relieved and so happy, Christine! It will be\n",
      "splendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety, won't\n",
      "it?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, anyhow I think it would be delightful to have what one\n",
      "needs.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, not only what one needs, but heaps and heaps of money.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (smiling). Nora, Nora, haven't you learned sense yet? In our\n",
      "schooldays you were a great spendthrift.\n",
      "Nora Nora (laughing). Yes, that is what Torvald says now. (Wags her finger at\n",
      "her.) But \"Nora, Nora\" is not so silly as you think. We have not been in\n",
      "a position for me to waste money. We have both had to work.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. You too?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes; odds and ends, needlework, crotchet-work, embroidery, and\n",
      "that kind of thing. (Dropping her voice.) And other things as well. You\n",
      "know Torvald left his office when we were married? There was no prospect\n",
      "of promotion there, and he had to try and earn more than before. But\n",
      "during the first year he over-worked himself dreadfully. You see, he had\n",
      "to make money every way he could, and he worked early and late; but he\n",
      "couldn't stand it, and fell dreadfully ill, and the doctors said it was\n",
      "necessary for him to go south.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. You spent a whole year in Italy, didn't you?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes. It was no easy matter to get away, I can tell you. It\n",
      "was just after Ivar was born; but naturally we had to go. It was a\n",
      "wonderfully beautiful journey, and it saved Torvald's life. But it cost\n",
      "a tremendous lot of money, Christine.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. So I should think.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It cost about two hundred and fifty pounds. That's a lot, isn't\n",
      "it?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the\n",
      "money.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I ought to tell you that we had it from papa.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Oh, I see. It was just about that time that he died, wasn't\n",
      "it?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes; and, just think of it, I couldn't go and nurse him. I was\n",
      "expecting little Ivar's birth every day and I had my poor sick Torvald\n",
      "to look after. My dear, kind father--I never saw him again, Christine.\n",
      "That was the saddest time I have known since our marriage.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I know how fond you were of him. And then you went off to\n",
      "Italy?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes; you see we had money then, and the doctors insisted on our\n",
      "going, so we started a month later.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. And your husband came back quite well?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. As sound as a bell!\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But--the doctor?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What doctor?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just\n",
      "as I did, was the doctor?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, that was Doctor Rank, but he doesn't come here\n",
      "professionally. He is our greatest friend, and comes in at least once\n",
      "every day. No, Torvald has not had an hour's illness since then, and our\n",
      "children are strong and healthy and so am I. (Jumps up and claps her\n",
      "hands.) Christine! Christine! it's good to be alive and happy!--But how\n",
      "horrid of me; I am talking of nothing but my own affairs. (Sits on a\n",
      "stool near her, and rests her arms on her knees.) You mustn't be angry\n",
      "with me. Tell me, is it really true that you did not love your husband?\n",
      "Why did you marry him?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. My mother was alive then, and was bedridden and helpless,\n",
      "and I had to provide for my two younger brothers; so I did not think I\n",
      "was justified in refusing his offer.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, perhaps you were quite right. He was rich at that time, then?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I believe he was quite well off. But his business was a\n",
      "precarious one; and, when he died, it all went to pieces and there was\n",
      "nothing left.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And then?--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Well, I had to turn my hand to anything I could find--first\n",
      "a small shop, then a small school, and so on. The last three years have\n",
      "seemed like one long working-day, with no rest. Now it is at an end,\n",
      "Nora. My poor mother needs me no more, for she is gone; and the boys\n",
      "do not need me either; they have got situations and can shift for\n",
      "themselves.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What a relief you must feel if--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No, indeed; I only feel my life unspeakably empty. No one to\n",
      "live for anymore. (Gets up restlessly.) That was why I could not stand\n",
      "the life in my little backwater any longer. I hope it may be easier here\n",
      "to find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts. If only I\n",
      "could have the good luck to get some regular work--office work of some\n",
      "kind--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. But, Christine, that is so frightfully tiring, and you look tired\n",
      "out now. You had far better go away to some watering-place.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (walking to the window). I have no father to give me money\n",
      "for a journey, Nora.\n",
      "Nora Nora (rising). Oh, don't be angry with me!\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (going up to her). It is you that must not be angry with me,\n",
      "dear. The worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter.\n",
      "No one to work for, and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for\n",
      "chances. One must live, and so one becomes selfish. When you told me of\n",
      "the happy turn your fortunes have taken--you will hardly believe it--I\n",
      "was delighted not so much on your account as on my own.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. How do you mean?--Oh, I understand. You mean that perhaps Torvald\n",
      "could get you something to do.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, that was what I was thinking of.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. He must, Christine. Just leave it to me; I will broach the subject\n",
      "very cleverly--I will think of something that will please him very much.\n",
      "It will make me so happy to be of some use to you.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. How kind you are, Nora, to be so anxious to help me! It is\n",
      "doubly kind in you, for you know so little of the burdens and troubles\n",
      "of life.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I--? I know so little of them?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (smiling). My dear! Small household cares and that sort of\n",
      "thing!--You are a child, Nora.\n",
      "Nora Nora (tosses her head and crosses the stage). You ought not to be so\n",
      "superior.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You are just like the others. They all think that I am incapable\n",
      "of anything really serious--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Come, come--\n",
      "Nora.--that Nora.--that I have gone through nothing in this world of cares.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But, my dear Nora, you have just told me all your troubles.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Pooh!--those were trifles. (Lowering her voice.) I have not told\n",
      "you the important thing.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. The important thing? What do you mean?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You look down upon me altogether, Christine--but you ought not to.\n",
      "You are proud, aren't you, of having worked so hard and so long for your\n",
      "mother?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Indeed, I don't look down on anyone. But it is true that I\n",
      "am both proud and glad to think that I was privileged to make the end of\n",
      "my mother's life almost free from care.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And you are proud to think of what you have done for your\n",
      "brothers?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I think I have the right to be.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I think so, too. But now, listen to this; I too have something to\n",
      "be proud and glad of.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I have no doubt you have. But what do you refer to?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Speak low. Suppose Torvald were to hear! He mustn't on any\n",
      "account--no one in the world must know, Christine, except you.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But what is it?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Come here. (Pulls her down on the sofa beside her.) Now I will\n",
      "show you that I too have something to be proud and glad of. It was I who\n",
      "saved Torvald's life.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. \"Saved\"? How?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I told you about our trip to Italy. Torvald would never have\n",
      "recovered if he had not gone there--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, but your father gave you the necessary funds.\n",
      "Nora Nora (smiling). Yes, that is what Torvald and all the others think,\n",
      "but--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Papa didn't give us a shilling. It was I who procured the money.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. You? All that large sum?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Two hundred and fifty pounds. What do you think of that?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But, Nora, how could you possibly do it? Did you win a prize\n",
      "in the Lottery?\n",
      "Nora Nora (contemptuously). In the Lottery? There would have been no credit\n",
      "in that.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But where did you get it from, then? Nora (humming and\n",
      "smiling with an air of mystery). Hm, hm! Aha!\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Because you couldn't have borrowed it.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Couldn't I? Why not?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No, a wife cannot borrow without her husband's consent.\n",
      "Nora Nora (tossing her head). Oh, if it is a wife who has any head for\n",
      "business--a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I don't understand it at all, Nora.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. There is no need you should. I never said I had borrowed the\n",
      "money. I may have got it some other way. (Lies back on the sofa.)\n",
      "Perhaps I got it from some other admirer. When anyone is as attractive\n",
      "as I am--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. You are a mad creature.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Now, you know you're full of curiosity, Christine.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Listen to me, Nora dear. Haven't you been a little bit\n",
      "imprudent?\n",
      "Nora Nora (sits up straight). Is it imprudent to save your husband's life?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. It seems to me imprudent, without his knowledge, to--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. But it was absolutely necessary that he should not know! My\n",
      "goodness, can't you understand that? It was necessary he should have no\n",
      "idea what a dangerous condition he was in. It was to me that the doctors\n",
      "came and said that his life was in danger, and that the only thing to\n",
      "save him was to live in the south. Do you suppose I didn't try, first of\n",
      "all, to get what I wanted as if it were for myself? I told him how much\n",
      "I should love to travel abroad like other young wives; I tried tears and\n",
      "entreaties with him; I told him that he ought to remember the condition\n",
      "I was in, and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me; I even\n",
      "hinted that he might raise a loan. That nearly made him angry,\n",
      "Christine. He said I was thoughtless, and that it was his duty as my\n",
      "husband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices--as I believe he\n",
      "called them. Very well, I thought, you must be saved--and that was how I\n",
      "came to devise a way out of the difficulty--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. And did your husband never get to know from your father that\n",
      "the money had not come from him?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, never. Papa died just at that time. I had meant to let him\n",
      "into the secret and beg him never to reveal it. But he was so ill\n",
      "then--alas, there never was any need to tell him.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. And since then have you never told your secret to your\n",
      "husband?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Good Heavens, no! How could you think so? A man who has such\n",
      "strong opinions about these things! And besides, how painful and\n",
      "humiliating it would be for Torvald, with his manly independence, to\n",
      "know that he owed me anything! It would upset our mutual relations\n",
      "altogether; our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Do you mean never to tell him about it?\n",
      "Nora Nora (meditatively, and with a half smile). Yes--someday, perhaps, after\n",
      "many years, when I am no longer as nice-looking as I am now. Don't laugh\n",
      "at me! I mean, of course, when Torvald is no longer as devoted to me as\n",
      "he is now; when my dancing and dressing-up and reciting have palled on\n",
      "him; then it may be a good thing to have something in reserve--(Breaking\n",
      "off.) What nonsense! That time will never come. Now, what do you think\n",
      "of my great secret, Christine? Do you still think I am of no use? I can\n",
      "tell you, too, that this affair has caused me a lot of worry. It has\n",
      "been by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually. I may\n",
      "tell you that there is something that is called, in business, quarterly\n",
      "interest, and another thing called payment in installments, and it is\n",
      "always so dreadfully difficult to manage them. I have had to save a\n",
      "little here and there, where I could, you understand. I have not been\n",
      "able to put aside much from my housekeeping money, for Torvald must have\n",
      "a good table. I couldn't let my children be shabbily dressed; I have\n",
      "felt obliged to use up all he gave me for them, the sweet little\n",
      "darlings!\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. So it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of\n",
      "life, poor Nora?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Of course. Besides, I was the one responsible for it. Whenever\n",
      "Torvald has given me money for new dresses and such things, I have\n",
      "never spent more than half of it; I have always bought the simplest\n",
      "and cheapest things. Thank Heaven, any clothes look well on me, and\n",
      "so Torvald has never noticed it. But it was often very hard on me,\n",
      "Christine--because it is delightful to be really well dressed, isn't it?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Quite so.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Well, then I have found other ways of earning money. Last winter\n",
      "I was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do; so I locked myself up\n",
      "and sat writing every evening until quite late at night. Many a time I\n",
      "was desperately tired; but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to\n",
      "sit there working and earning money. It was like being a man.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. How much have you been able to pay off in that way?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I can't tell you exactly. You see, it is very difficult to keep an\n",
      "account of a business matter of that kind. I only know that I have paid\n",
      "every penny that I could scrape together. Many a time I was at my wits'\n",
      "end. (Smiles.) Then I used to sit here and imagine that a rich old\n",
      "gentleman had fallen in love with me--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. What! Who was it?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Be quiet!--that he had died; and that when his will was opened\n",
      "it contained, written in big letters, the instruction: \"The lovely Mrs.\n",
      "Nora Helmer is to have all I possess paid over to her at once in cash.\"\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But, my dear Nora--who could the man be?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Good gracious, can't you understand? There was no old gentleman at\n",
      "all; it was only something that I used to sit here and imagine, when I\n",
      "couldn't think of any way of procuring money. But it's all the same now;\n",
      "the tiresome old person can stay where he is, as far as I am concerned;\n",
      "I don't care about him or his will either, for I am free from care now.\n",
      "(Jumps up.) My goodness, it's delightful to think of, Christine! Free\n",
      "from care! To be able to be free from care, quite free from care; to be\n",
      "able to play and romp with the children; to be able to keep the house\n",
      "beautifully and have everything just as Torvald likes it! And, think of\n",
      "it, soon the spring will come and the big blue sky! Perhaps we shall be\n",
      "able to take a little trip--perhaps I shall see the sea again! Oh, it's\n",
      "a wonderful thing to be alive and be happy. (A bell is heard in the\n",
      "hall.)\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (rising). There is the bell; perhaps I had better go.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, don't go; no one will come in here; it is sure to be for\n",
      "Torvald.\n",
      "Servant Servant (at the hall door). Excuse me, ma'am--there is a gentleman to\n",
      "see the master, and as the doctor is with him--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Who is it?\n",
      "Krogstad Krogstad (at the door). It is I, Mrs. Helmer. (Mrs. LINDE starts,\n",
      "trembles, and turns to the window.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (takes a step towards him, and speaks in a strained, low voice).\n",
      "You? What is it? What do you want to see my husband about?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Bank business--in a way. I have a small post in the Bank, and\n",
      "I hear your husband is to be our chief now--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Then it is--\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Nothing but dry business matters, Mrs. Helmer; absolutely\n",
      "nothing else.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Be so good as to go into the study, then. (She bows indifferently\n",
      "to him and shuts the door into the hall; then comes back and makes up\n",
      "the fire in the stove.)\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Nora--who was that man?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. A lawyer, of the name of Krogstad.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Then it really was he.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Do you know the man?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I used to--many years ago. At one time he was a solicitor's\n",
      "clerk in our town.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, he was.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. He is greatly altered.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. He made a very unhappy marriage.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. He is a widower now, isn't he?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. With several children. There now, it is burning up. (Shuts the\n",
      "door of the stove and moves the rocking-chair aside.)\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. They say he carries on various kinds of business.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Really! Perhaps he does; I don't know anything about it. But don't\n",
      "let us think of business; it is so tiresome.\n",
      "Doctor Doctor Rank (comes out of HELMER'S study. Before he shuts the door he\n",
      "calls to him). No, my dear fellow, I won't disturb you; I would rather\n",
      "go in to your wife for a little while. (Shuts the door and sees Mrs.\n",
      "LINDE.) I beg your pardon; I am afraid I am disturbing you too.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, not at all. (Introducing him). Doctor Rank, Mrs. Linde.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I have often heard Mrs. Linde's name mentioned here. I think I\n",
      "passed you on the stairs when I arrived, Mrs. Linde?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, I go up very slowly; I can't manage stairs well.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Ah! some slight internal weakness?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No, the fact is I have been overworking myself.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Nothing more than that? Then I suppose you have come to town to\n",
      "amuse yourself with our entertainments?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I have come to look for work.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Is that a good cure for overwork?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. One must live, Doctor Rank.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Look here, Doctor Rank--you know you want to live.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Certainly. However wretched I may feel, I want to prolong the\n",
      "agony as long as possible. All my patients are like that. And so are\n",
      "those who are morally diseased; one of them, and a bad case too, is at\n",
      "this very moment with Helmer--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (sadly). Ah!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Whom do you mean?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. A lawyer of the name of Krogstad, a fellow you don't know at all.\n",
      "He suffers from a diseased moral character, Mrs. Helmer; but even he\n",
      "began talking of its being highly important that he should live.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Did he? What did he want to speak to Torvald about?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I have no idea; I only heard that it was something about the Bank.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I didn't know this--what's his name--Krogstad had anything to do\n",
      "with the Bank.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, he has some sort of appointment there. (To Mrs. LINDE.) I\n",
      "don't know whether you find also in your part of the world that there\n",
      "are certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moral\n",
      "corruption, and, as soon as they have found some, put the person\n",
      "concerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye on\n",
      "him. Healthy natures are left out in the cold.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Still I think the sick are those who most need taking care\n",
      "of.\n",
      "Rank Rank (shrugging his shoulders). Yes, there you are. That is the\n",
      "sentiment that is turning Society into a sick-house.\n",
      "(NORA, (NORA, who has been absorbed in her thoughts, breaks out into smothered\n",
      "laughter and claps her hands.)\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Why do you laugh at that? Have you any notion what Society really\n",
      "is?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do I care about tiresome Society? I am laughing at something\n",
      "quite different, something extremely amusing. Tell me, Doctor Rank, are\n",
      "all the people who are employed in the Bank dependent on Torvald now?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Is that what you find so extremely amusing?\n",
      "Nora Nora (smiling and humming). That's my affair! (Walking about the room.)\n",
      "It's perfectly glorious to think that we have--that Torvald has so much\n",
      "power over so many people. (Takes the packet from her pocket.) Doctor\n",
      "Rank, what do you say to a macaroon?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. What, macaroons? I thought they were forbidden here.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, but these are some Christine gave me.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. What! I?--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Oh, well, don't be alarmed! You couldn't know that Torvald had\n",
      "forbidden them. I must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil my\n",
      "teeth. But, bah!--once in a way--That's so, isn't it, Doctor Rank? By\n",
      "your leave! (Puts a macaroon into his mouth.) You must have one too,\n",
      "Christine. And I shall have one, just a little one--or at most two.\n",
      "(Walking about.) I am tremendously happy. There is just one thing in the\n",
      "world now that I should dearly love to do.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Well, what is that?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It's something I should dearly love to say, if Torvald could hear\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Well, why can't you say it?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, I daren't; it's so shocking.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Shocking?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Well, I should not advise you to say it. Still, with us you might.\n",
      "What is it you would so much like to say if Torvald could hear you?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I should just love to say--Well, I'm damned!\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Are you mad?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Nora, dear--!\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Say it, here he is!\n",
      "Nora Nora (hiding the packet). Hush! Hush! Hush! (HELMER comes out of his\n",
      "room, with his coat over his arm and his hat in his hand.)\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Well, Torvald dear, have you got rid of him?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes, he has just gone.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Let me introduce you--this is Christine, who has come to town.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Christine--? Excuse me, but I don't know--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Mrs. Linde, dear; Christine Linde.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Of course. A school friend of my wife's, I presume?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, we have known each other since then.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And just think, she has taken a long journey in order to see you.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What do you mean? Mrs. Linde. No, really, I--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Christine is tremendously clever at book-keeping, and she is\n",
      "frightfully anxious to work under some clever man, so as to perfect\n",
      "herself--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Very sensible, Mrs. Linde.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And when she heard you had been appointed manager of the Bank--the\n",
      "news was telegraphed, you know--she travelled here as quick as\n",
      "she could. Torvald, I am sure you will be able to do something for\n",
      "Christine, for my sake, won't you?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Well, it is not altogether impossible. I presume you are a\n",
      "widow, Mrs. Linde?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And have had some experience of book-keeping?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, a fair amount.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Ah! well, it's very likely I may be able to find something for\n",
      "you--\n",
      "Nora Nora (clapping her hands). What did I tell you? What did I tell you?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You have just come at a fortunate moment, Mrs. Linde.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. How am I to thank you?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. There is no need. (Puts on his coat.) But today you must excuse\n",
      "me--\n",

      "Nora. Nora. She is. But I don't see--\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I knew her too, once upon a time.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I am aware of that.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Are you? So you know all about it; I thought as much. Then I\n",
      "can ask you, without beating about the bush--is Mrs. Linde to have an\n",
      "appointment in the Bank?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What right have you to question me, Mr. Krogstad?--You, one of\n",
      "my husband's subordinates! But since you ask, you shall know. Yes, Mrs.\n",
      "Linde is to have an appointment. And it was I who pleaded her cause, Mr.\n",

      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Who has influence?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Exactly.\n",
      "Krogstad Krogstad (changing his tone). Mrs. Helmer, you will be so good as to use\n",
      "your influence on my behalf.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What? What do you mean?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. You will be so kind as to see that I am allowed to keep my\n",
      "subordinate position in the Bank.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do you mean by that? Who proposes to take your post away from\n",
      "you?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Oh, there is no necessity to keep up the pretence of\n",
      "ignorance. I can quite understand that your friend is not very anxious\n",
      "to expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me; and I\n",
      "quite understand, too, whom I have to thank for being turned off.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. But I assure you--\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Very likely; but, to come to the point, the time has come when\n",
      "I should advise you to use your influence to prevent that.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. But, Mr. Krogstad, I have no influence.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Haven't you? I thought you said yourself just now--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Naturally I did not mean you to put that construction on it. I!\n",
      "What should make you think I have any influence of that kind with my\n",
      "husband?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Oh, I have known your husband from our student days. I don't\n",
      "suppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. If you speak slightingly of my husband, I shall turn you out of\n",
      "the house.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. You are bold, Mrs. Helmer.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I am not afraid of you any longer. As soon as the New Year comes,\n",
      "I shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing.\n",
      "Krogstad Krogstad (controlling himself). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. If necessary,\n",
      "I am prepared to fight for my small post in the Bank as if I were\n",
      "fighting for my life.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. So it seems.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. It is not only for the sake of the money; indeed, that weighs\n",
      "least with me in the matter. There is another reason--well, I may as\n",
      "well tell you. My position is this. I daresay you know, like everybody\n",
      "else, that once, many years ago, I was guilty of an indiscretion.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I think I have heard something of the kind.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. The matter never came into court; but every way seemed to be\n",
      "closed to me after that. So I took to the business that you know of. I\n",
      "had to do something; and, honestly, I don't think I've been one of the\n",
      "worst. But now I must cut myself free from all that. My sons are growing\n",
      "up; for their sake I must try and win back as much respect as I can in\n",
      "the town. This post in the Bank was like the first step up for me--and\n",
      "now your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. But you must believe me, Mr. Krogstad; it is not in my power to\n",
      "help you at all.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Then it is because you haven't the will; but I have means to\n",
      "compel you.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You don't mean that you will tell my husband that I owe you money?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Hm!--suppose I were to tell him?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It would be perfectly infamous of you. (Sobbing.) To think of his\n",
      "learning my secret, which has been my joy and pride, in such an ugly,\n",
      "clumsy way--that he should learn it from you! And it would put me in a\n",
      "horribly disagreeable position--\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Only disagreeable?\n",
      "Nora Nora (impetuously). Well, do it, then!--and it will be the worse for\n",
      "you. My husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are, and you\n",
      "certainly won't keep your post then.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that\n",
      "you were afraid of?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. If my husband does get to know of it, of course he will at once\n",
      "pay you what is still owing, and we shall have nothing more to do with\n",
      "you.\n",
      "Krogstad Krogstad (coming a step nearer). Listen to me, Mrs. Helmer. Either you\n",
      "have a very bad memory or you know very little of business. I shall be\n",
      "obliged to remind you of a few details.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do you mean?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. When your husband was ill, you came to me to borrow two\n",
      "hundred and fifty pounds.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I didn't know anyone else to go to.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I promised to get you that amount--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, and you did so.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I promised to get you that amount, on certain conditions.\n",
      "Your mind was so taken up with your husband's illness, and you were so\n",
      "anxious to get the money for your journey, that you seem to have paid\n",
      "no attention to the conditions of our bargain. Therefore it will not be\n",
      "amiss if I remind you of them. Now, I promised to get the money on the\n",
      "security of a bond which I drew up.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, and which I signed.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Good. But below your signature there were a few lines\n",
      "constituting your father a surety for the money; those lines your father\n",
      "should have signed.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Should? He did sign them.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I had left the date blank; that is to say, your father should\n",
      "himself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper. Do you\n",
      "remember that?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, I think I remember--\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Then I gave you the bond to send by post to your father. Is\n",
      "that not so?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. And you naturally did so at once, because five or six days\n",
      "afterwards you brought me the bond with your father's signature. And\n",
      "then I gave you the money.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Well, haven't I been paying it off regularly?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Fairly so, yes. But--to come back to the matter in hand--that\n",
      "must have been a very trying time for you, Mrs. Helmer?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It was, indeed.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Your father was very ill, wasn't he?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. He was very near his end.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. And died soon afterwards?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Tell me, Mrs. Helmer, can you by any chance remember what day\n",
      "your father died?--on what day of the month, I mean.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Papa died on the 29th of September.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. That is correct; I have ascertained it for myself. And, as\n",
      "that is so, there is a discrepancy (taking a paper from his pocket)\n",
      "which I cannot account for.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What discrepancy? I don't know--\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. The discrepancy consists, Mrs. Helmer, in the fact that your\n",
      "father signed this bond three days after his death.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do you mean? I don't understand--\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Your father died on the 29th of September. But, look here;\n",
      "your father has dated his signature the 2nd of October. It is a\n",
      "discrepancy, isn't it? (NORA is silent.) Can you explain it to me? (NORA\n",
      "is still silent.) It is a remarkable thing, too, that the words \"2nd\n",
      "of October,\" as well as the year, are not written in your father's\n",
      "handwriting but in one that I think I know. Well, of course it can be\n",
      "explained; your father may have forgotten to date his signature, and\n",
      "someone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death.\n",
      "There is no harm in that. It all depends on the signature of the name;\n",
      "and that is genuine, I suppose, Mrs. Helmer? It was your father himself\n",
      "who signed his name here?\n",
      "Nora Nora (after a short pause, throws her head up and looks defiantly at\n",
      "him). No, it was not. It was I that wrote papa's name.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Are you aware that is a dangerous confession?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. In what way? You shall have your money soon.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Let me ask you a question; why did you not send the paper to\n",
      "your father?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It was impossible; papa was so ill. If I had asked him for his\n",
      "signature, I should have had to tell him what the money was to be\n",
      "used for; and when he was so ill himself I couldn't tell him that my\n",
      "husband's life was in danger--it was impossible.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. It would have been better for you if you had given up your\n",
      "trip abroad.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, that was impossible. That trip was to save my husband's life;\n",
      "I couldn't give that up.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. But did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraud\n",
      "on me?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I couldn't take that into account; I didn't trouble myself about\n",
      "you at all. I couldn't bear you, because you put so many heartless\n",
      "difficulties in my way, although you knew what a dangerous condition my\n",
      "husband was in.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Mrs. Helmer, you evidently do not realise clearly what it is\n",
      "that you have been guilty of. But I can assure you that my one false\n",
      "step, which lost me all my reputation, was nothing more or nothing worse\n",
      "than what you have done.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You? Do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a\n",
      "risk to save your wife's life?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. The law cares nothing about motives.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Then it must be a very foolish law.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Foolish or not, it is the law by which you will be judged, if\n",
      "I produce this paper in court.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I don't believe it. Is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her\n",
      "dying father anxiety and care? Is a wife not to be allowed to save her\n",
      "husband's life? I don't know much about law; but I am certain that there\n",
      "must be laws permitting such things as that. Have you no knowledge of\n",
      "such laws--you who are a lawyer? You must be a very poor lawyer, Mr.\n",
      "Krogstad.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Maybe. But matters of business--such business as you and I\n",
      "have had together--do you think I don't understand that? Very well. Do\n",
      "as you please. But let me tell you this--if I lose my position a second\n",
      "time, you shall lose yours with me. (He bows, and goes out through the\n",
      "hall.)\n",

      "thinks. (Begins to busy herself putting the children's things in order.)\n",

      "I must make use of the Christmas week for that, so as to have everything\n",
      "in order for the new year.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Then that was why this poor Krogstad--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Hm!\n",

      "hadn't been so busy I should have asked you a tremendously big favour,\n",
      "Torvald.\n",

      "look nice at the fancy-dress ball. Torvald, couldn't you take me in hand\n",
      "and decide what I shall go as, and what sort of a dress I shall wear?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Aha! so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone to\n",
      "come to her rescue?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, Torvald, I can't get along a bit without your help.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Very well, I will think it over, we shall manage to hit upon\n",
      "something.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. That is nice of you. (Goes to the Christmas Tree. A short pause.)\n",
      "How pretty the red flowers look--. But, tell me, was it really something\n",
      "very bad that this Krogstad was guilty of?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. He forged someone's name. Have you any idea what that means?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Isn't it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes; or, as in so many cases, by imprudence. I am not so\n",
      "heartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false step\n",
      "of that kind.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, you wouldn't, would you, Torvald?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Many a man has been able to retrieve his character, if he has\n",
      "openly confessed his fault and taken his punishment.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Punishment--?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. But Krogstad did nothing of that sort; he got himself out of it\n",
      "by a cunning trick, and that is why he has gone under altogether.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. But do you think it would--?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play the\n",
      "hypocrite with every one, how he has to wear a mask in the presence of\n",
      "those near and dear to him, even before his own wife and children. And\n",
      "about the children--that is the most terrible part of it all, Nora.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. How?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the whole\n",
      "life of a home. Each breath the children take in such a house is full of\n",
      "the germs of evil.\n",
      "Nora Nora (coming nearer him). Are you sure of that?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. My dear, I have often seen it in the course of my life as a\n",
      "lawyer. Almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had a\n",
      "deceitful mother.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Why do you only say--mother?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. It seems most commonly to be the mother's influence, though\n",
      "naturally a bad father's would have the same result. Every lawyer\n",
      "is familiar with the fact. This Krogstad, now, has been persistently\n",
      "poisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation; that is why I\n",
      "say he has lost all moral character. (Holds out his hands to her.) That\n",

      "daughter for nothing. But tell me, is Doctor Rank always as depressed as\n",
      "he was yesterday?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No; yesterday it was very noticeable. I must tell you that he\n",
      "suffers from a very dangerous disease. He has consumption of the spine,\n",
      "poor creature. His father was a horrible man who committed all sorts\n",

      "now and then from--from married women, who know something of medical\n",
      "matters, and they talk about one thing and another.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (goes on sewing. A short silence). Does Doctor Rank come here\n",
      "everyday?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Everyday regularly. He is Torvald's most intimate friend, and a\n",
      "great friend of mine too. He is just like one of the family.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But tell me this--is he perfectly sincere? I mean, isn't he\n",
      "the kind of man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Not in the least. What makes you think that?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. When you introduced him to me yesterday, he declared he had\n",
      "often heard my name mentioned in this house; but afterwards I noticed\n",
      "that your husband hadn't the slightest idea who I was. So how could\n",
      "Doctor Rank--?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. That is quite right, Christine. Torvald is so absurdly fond of me\n",
      "that he wants me absolutely to himself, as he says. At first he used\n",
      "to seem almost jealous if I mentioned any of the dear folk at home, so\n",
      "naturally I gave up doing so. But I often talk about such things with\n",
      "Doctor Rank, because he likes hearing about them.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Listen to me, Nora. You are still very like a child in many\n",
      "things, and I am older than you in many ways and have a little more\n",
      "experience. Let me tell you this--you ought to make an end of it with\n",
      "Doctor Rank.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What ought I to make an end of?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Of two things, I think. Yesterday you talked some nonsense\n",
      "about a rich admirer who was to leave you money--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. An admirer who doesn't exist, unfortunately! But what then?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Is Doctor Rank a man of means?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, he is.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. And has no one to provide for?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, no one; but--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. And comes here everyday?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, I told you so.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But how can this well-bred man be so tactless?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I don't understand you at all.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Don't prevaricate, Nora. Do you suppose I don't guess who\n",
      "lent you the two hundred and fifty pounds?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Are you out of your senses? How can you think of such a thing! A\n",
      "friend of ours, who comes here everyday! Do you realise what a horribly\n",
      "painful position that would be?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Then it really isn't he?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, certainly not. It would never have entered into my head for\n",
      "a moment. Besides, he had no money to lend then; he came into his money\n",
      "afterwards.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Well, I think that was lucky for you, my dear Nora.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, it would never have come into my head to ask Doctor Rank.\n",
      "Although I am quite sure that if I had asked him--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. But of course you won't.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Of course not. I have no reason to think it could possibly be\n",
      "necessary. But I am quite sure that if I told Doctor Rank--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Behind your husband's back?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I must make an end of it with the other one, and that will be\n",
      "behind his back too. I must make an end of it with him.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, that is what I told you yesterday, but--\n",
      "Nora Nora (walking up and down). A man can put a thing like that straight\n",
      "much easier than a woman--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. One's husband, yes.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Nonsense! (Standing still.) When you pay off a debt you get your\n",
      "bond back, don't you?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, as a matter of course.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces, and burn it\n",
      "up--the nasty dirty paper!\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (looks hard at her, lays down her sewing and gets up slowly).\n",
      "Nora, you are concealing something from me.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Do I look as if I were?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Something has happened to you since yesterday morning. Nora,\n",
      "what is it?\n",

      "come home. Do you mind going in to the children for the present? Torvald\n",
      "can't bear to see dressmaking going on. Let Anne help you.\n",

      "not going away from here until we have had it out with one another. (She\n",

      "You will see I shall look quite smart.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Wasn't that a happy thought of mine, now?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Splendid! But don't you think it is nice of me, too, to do as you\n",
      "wish?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nice?--because you do as your husband wishes? Well, well, you\n",
      "little rogue, I am sure you did not mean it in that way. But I am\n",
      "not going to disturb you; you will want to be trying on your dress, I\n",
      "expect.\n",

      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes. (Shows her a bundle of papers.) Look at that. I have just\n",
      "been into the bank. (Turns to go into his room.)\n",

      "prettily--?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What then?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Would you do it?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. I should like to hear what it is, first.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you would\n",
      "be nice, and do what she wants.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Speak plainly.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Your skylark would chirp about in every room, with her song rising\n",
      "and falling--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Well, my skylark does that anyhow.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight,\n",
      "Torvald.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora--you surely don't mean that request you made to me this\n",
      "morning?\n",
      "Nora Nora (going near him). Yes, Torvald, I beg you so earnestly--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Have you really the courage to open up that question again?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, dear, you must do as I ask; you must let Krogstad keep his\n",
      "post in the bank.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. My dear Nora, it is his post that I have arranged Mrs. Linde\n",
      "shall have.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, you have been awfully kind about that; but you could just as\n",
      "well dismiss some other clerk instead of Krogstad.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. This is simply incredible obstinacy! Because you chose to give\n",
      "him a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him, I am expected\n",
      "to--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. That isn't the reason, Torvald. It is for your own sake. This\n",
      "fellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers; you have told me so\n",
      "yourself. He can do you an unspeakable amount of harm. I am frightened\n",
      "to death of him--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Ah, I understand; it is recollections of the past that scare\n",
      "you.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do you mean?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Naturally you are thinking of your father.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes--yes, of course. Just recall to your mind what these malicious\n",
      "creatures wrote in the papers about papa, and how horribly they\n",
      "slandered him. I believe they would have procured his dismissal if the\n",
      "Department had not sent you over to inquire into it, and if you had not\n",
      "been so kindly disposed and helpful to him.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. My little Nora, there is an important difference between your\n",
      "father and me. Your father's reputation as a public official was not\n",
      "above suspicion. Mine is, and I hope it will continue to be so, as long\n",
      "as I hold my office.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You never can tell what mischief these men may contrive. We ought\n",
      "to be so well off, so snug and happy here in our peaceful home, and have\n",
      "no cares--you and I and the children, Torvald! That is why I beg you so\n",
      "earnestly--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And it is just by interceding for him that you make it\n",
      "impossible for me to keep him. It is already known at the Bank that I\n",
      "mean to dismiss Krogstad. Is it to get about now that the new manager\n",
      "has changed his mind at his wife's bidding--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And what if it did?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Of course!--if only this obstinate little person can get her\n",
      "way! Do you suppose I am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole\n",
      "staff, to let people think that I am a man to be swayed by all sorts of\n",
      "outside influence? I should very soon feel the consequences of it, I can\n",
      "tell you! And besides, there is one thing that makes it quite impossible\n",
      "for me to have Krogstad in the Bank as long as I am manager.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Whatever is that?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. His moral failings I might perhaps have overlooked, if\n",
      "necessary--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, you could--couldn't you?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And I hear he is a good worker, too. But I knew him when we\n",
      "were boys. It was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an\n",
      "incubus in afterlife. I may as well tell you plainly, we were once on\n",
      "very intimate terms with one another. But this tactless fellow lays no\n",
      "restraint on himself when other people are present. On the contrary,\n",
      "he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me, and\n",
      "every minute it is \"I say, Helmer, old fellow!\" and that sort of thing.\n",
      "I assure you it is extremely painful for me. He would make my position\n",
      "in the Bank intolerable.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Torvald, I don't believe you mean that.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Don't you? Why not?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Because it is such a narrow-minded way of looking at things.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What are you saying? Narrow-minded? Do you think I am\n",
      "narrow-minded?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, just the opposite, dear--and it is exactly for that reason.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. It's the same thing. You say my point of view is narrow-minded,\n",
      "so I must be so too. Narrow-minded! Very well--I must put an end to\n",
      "this. (Goes to the hall door and calls.) Helen!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What are you going to do?\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (looking among his papers). Settle it. (Enter MAID.) Look here;\n",
      "take this letter and go downstairs with it at once. Find a messenger and\n",
      "tell him to deliver it, and be quick. The address is on it, and here is\n",
      "the money.\n",
      "Maid. Maid. Very well, sir. (Exit with the letter.)\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (putting his papers together). Now then, little Miss Obstinate.\n",
      "Nora Nora (breathlessly). Torvald--what was that letter?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Krogstad's dismissal.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Call her back, Torvald! There is still time. Oh Torvald, call her\n",
      "back! Do it for my sake--for your own sake--for the children's sake! Do\n",
      "you hear me, Torvald? Call her back! You don't know what that letter can\n",
      "bring upon us.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. It's too late.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, it's too late.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. My dear Nora, I can forgive the anxiety you are in, although\n",
      "really it is an insult to me. It is, indeed. Isn't it an insult to think\n",
      "that I should be afraid of a starving quill-driver's vengeance? But I\n",
      "forgive you nevertheless, because it is such eloquent witness to your\n",
      "great love for me. (Takes her in his arms.) And that is as it should be,\n",
      "my own darling Nora. Come what will, you may be sure I shall have both\n",
      "courage and strength if they be needed. You will see I am man enough to\n",
      "take everything upon myself.\n",
      "Nora Nora (in a horror-stricken voice). What do you mean by that?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Everything, I say--\n",
      "Nora Nora (recovering herself). You will never have to do that.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. That's right. Well, we will share it, Nora, as man and wife\n",
      "should. That is how it shall be. (Caressing her.) Are you content now?\n",
      "There! There!--not these frightened dove's eyes! The whole thing is only\n",
      "the wildest fancy!--Now, you must go and play through the Tarantella and\n",
      "practise with your tambourine. I shall go into the inner office and shut\n",
      "the door, and I shall hear nothing; you can make as much noise as you\n",
      "please. (Turns back at the door.) And when Rank comes, tell him where he\n",
      "will find me. (Nods to her, takes his papers and goes into his room, and\n",
      "shuts the door after him.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (bewildered with anxiety, stands as if rooted to the spot, and\n",
      "whispers). He was capable of doing it. He will do it. He will do it in\n",
      "spite of everything.--No, not that! Never, never! Anything rather than\n",
      "that! Oh, for some help, some way out of it! (The door-bell rings.)\n",
      "Doctor Rank! Anything rather than that--anything, whatever it is! (She\n",
      "puts her hands over her face, pulls herself together, goes to the door\n",
      "and opens it. RANK is standing without, hanging up his coat. During the\n",
      "following dialogue it begins to grow dark.)\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Good day, Doctor Rank. I knew your ring. But you mustn't go in to\n",
      "Torvald now; I think he is busy with something.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. And you?\n",
      "Nora Nora (brings him in and shuts the door after him). Oh, you know very\n",
      "well I always have time for you.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Thank you. I shall make use of as much of it as I can.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do you mean by that? As much of it as you can?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Well, does that alarm you?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It was such a strange way of putting it. Is anything likely to\n",
      "happen?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Nothing but what I have long been prepared for. But I certainly\n",
      "didn't expect it to happen so soon.\n",
      "Nora Nora (gripping him by the arm). What have you found out? Doctor Rank,\n",
      "you must tell me.\n",
      "Rank Rank (sitting down by the stove). It is all up with me. And it can't be\n",
      "helped.\n",
      "Nora Nora (with a sigh of relief). Is it about yourself?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Who else? It is no use lying to one's self. I am the most wretched\n",
      "of all my patients, Mrs. Helmer. Lately I have been taking stock of my\n",
      "internal economy. Bankrupt! Probably within a month I shall lie rotting\n",
      "in the churchyard.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What an ugly thing to say!\n",
      "Rank. Rank. The thing itself is cursedly ugly, and the worst of it is that I\n",
      "shall have to face so much more that is ugly before that. I shall only\n",
      "make one more examination of myself; when I have done that, I shall know\n",
      "pretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will\n",
      "begin. There is something I want to tell you. Helmer's refined nature\n",
      "gives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly; I won't\n",
      "have him in my sick-room.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Oh, but, Doctor Rank--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I won't have him there. Not on any account. I bar my door to him.\n",
      "As soon as I am quite certain that the worst has come, I shall send\n",
      "you my card with a black cross on it, and then you will know that the\n",
      "loathsome end has begun.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You are quite absurd today. And I wanted you so much to be in a\n",
      "really good humour.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. With death stalking beside me?--To have to pay this penalty for\n",
      "another man's sin? Is there any justice in that? And in every single\n",
      "family, in one way or another, some such inexorable retribution is being\n",
      "exacted--\n",
      "Nora Nora (putting her hands over her ears). Rubbish! Do talk of something\n",
      "cheerful.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Oh, it's a mere laughing matter, the whole thing. My poor innocent\n",
      "spine has to suffer for my father's youthful amusements.\n",
      "Nora Nora (sitting at the table on the left). I suppose you mean that he was\n",
      "too partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras, don't you?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, and to truffles.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Truffles, yes. And oysters too, I suppose?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Oysters, of course, that goes without saying.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And heaps of port and champagne. It is sad that all these nice\n",
      "things should take their revenge on our bones.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky\n",
      "bones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, that's the saddest part of it all.\n",
      "Rank Rank (with a searching look at her). Hm!--\n",
      "Nora Nora (after a short pause). Why did you smile?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. No, it was you that laughed.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, it was you that smiled, Doctor Rank!\n",
      "Rank Rank (rising). You are a greater rascal than I thought.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I am in a silly mood today.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. So it seems.\n",
      "Nora Nora (putting her hands on his shoulders). Dear, dear Doctor Rank, death\n",
      "mustn't take you away from Torvald and me.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. It is a loss you would easily recover from. Those who are gone are\n",
      "soon forgotten.\n",
      "Nora Nora (looking at him anxiously). Do you believe that?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. People form new ties, and then--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Who will form new ties?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Both you and Helmer, when I am gone. You yourself are already on\n",
      "the high road to it, I think. What did that Mrs. Linde want here last\n",
      "night?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Oho!--you don't mean to say you are jealous of poor Christine?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, I am. She will be my successor in this house. When I am done\n",
      "for, this woman will--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Hush! don't speak so loud. She is in that room.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Today again. There, you see.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. She has only come to sew my dress for me. Bless my soul, how\n",
      "unreasonable you are! (Sits down on the sofa.) Be nice now, Doctor Rank,\n",
      "and tomorrow you will see how beautifully I shall dance, and you can\n",
      "imagine I am doing it all for you--and for Torvald too, of course.\n",
      "(Takes various things out of the box.) Doctor Rank, come and sit down\n",
      "here, and I will show you something.\n",
      "Rank Rank (sitting down). What is it?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Just look at those!\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Silk stockings.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Flesh-coloured. Aren't they lovely? It is so dark here now, but\n",
      "tomorrow--. No, no, no! you must only look at the feet. Oh well, you may\n",
      "have leave to look at the legs too.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Hm!--Nora. Why are you looking so critical? Don't you think they\n",
      "will fit me?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I have no means of forming an opinion about that.\n",
      "Nora Nora (looks at him for a moment). For shame! (Hits him lightly on the\n",
      "ear with the stockings.) That's to punish you. (Folds them up again.)\n",
      "Rank. Rank. And what other nice things am I to be allowed to see?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Not a single thing more, for being so naughty. (She looks among\n",
      "the things, humming to herself.)\n",
      "Rank Rank (after a short silence). When I am sitting here, talking to you as\n",
      "intimately as this, I cannot imagine for a moment what would have become\n",
      "of me if I had never come into this house.\n",
      "Nora Nora (smiling). I believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us.\n",
      "Rank Rank (in a lower voice, looking straight in front of him). And to be\n",
      "obliged to leave it all--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Nonsense, you are not going to leave it.\n",
      "Rank Rank (as before). And not be able to leave behind one the slightest\n",
      "token of one's gratitude, scarcely even a fleeting regret--nothing but\n",
      "an empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And if I asked you now for a--? No!\n",
      "Rank. Rank. For what?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. For a big proof of your friendship--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, yes!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I mean a tremendously big favour--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Would you really make me so happy for once?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Ah, but you don't know what it is yet.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. No--but tell me.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I really can't, Doctor Rank. It is something out of all reason; it\n",
      "means advice, and help, and a favour--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. The bigger a thing it is the better. I can't conceive what it is\n",
      "you mean. Do tell me. Haven't I your confidence?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. More than anyone else. I know you are my truest and best friend,\n",
      "and so I will tell you what it is. Well, Doctor Rank, it is something\n",
      "you must help me to prevent. You know how devotedly, how inexpressibly\n",
      "deeply Torvald loves me; he would never for a moment hesitate to give\n",
      "his life for me.\n",
      "Rank Rank (leaning towards her). Nora--do you think he is the only one--?\n",
      "Nora Nora (with a slight start). The only one--?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. The only one who would gladly give his life for your sake.\n",
      "Nora Nora (sadly). Is that it?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I was determined you should know it before I went away, and there\n",
      "will never be a better opportunity than this. Now you know it, Nora. And\n",
      "now you know, too, that you can trust me as you would trust no one else.\n",
      "Nora Nora (rises, deliberately and quietly). Let me pass.\n",
      "Rank Rank (makes room for her to pass him, but sits still). Nora!\n",
      "Nora Nora (at the hall door). Helen, bring in the lamp. (Goes over to the\n",
      "stove.) Dear Doctor Rank, that was really horrid of you.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. To have loved you as much as anyone else does? Was that horrid?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, but to go and tell me so. There was really no need--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. What do you mean? Did you know--? (MAID enters with lamp, puts it\n",
      "down on the table, and goes out.) Nora--Mrs. Helmer--tell me, had you\n",
      "any idea of this?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Oh, how do I know whether I had or whether I hadn't? I really\n",
      "can't tell you--To think you could be so clumsy, Doctor Rank! We were\n",
      "getting on so nicely.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Well, at all events you know now that you can command me, body and\n",
      "soul. So won't you speak out?\n",
      "Nora Nora (looking at him). After what happened?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I beg you to let me know what it is.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I can't tell you anything now.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, yes. You mustn't punish me in that way. Let me have\n",
      "permission to do for you whatever a man may do.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You can do nothing for me now. Besides, I really don't need any\n",
      "help at all. You will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on my\n",
      "part. It really is so--of course it is! (Sits down in the rocking-chair,\n",
      "and looks at him with a smile.) You are a nice sort of man, Doctor\n",
      "Rank!--don't you feel ashamed of yourself, now the lamp has come?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Not a bit. But perhaps I had better go--for ever?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, indeed, you shall not. Of course you must come here just as\n",
      "before. You know very well Torvald can't do without you.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, but you?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Oh, I am always tremendously pleased when you come.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. It is just that, that put me on the wrong track. You are a riddle\n",
      "to me. I have often thought that you would almost as soon be in my\n",
      "company as in Helmer's.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes--you see there are some people one loves best, and others whom\n",
      "one would almost always rather have as companions.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, there is something in that.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. When I was at home, of course I loved papa best. But I always\n",
      "thought it tremendous fun if I could steal down into the maids' room,\n",
      "because they never moralised at all, and talked to each other about such\n",
      "entertaining things.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I see--it is their place I have taken.\n",
      "Nora Nora (jumping up and going to him). Oh, dear, nice Doctor Rank, I never\n",
      "meant that at all. But surely you can understand that being with Torvald\n",
      "is a little like being with papa--(Enter MAID from the hall.)\n",
      "Maid. Maid. If you please, ma'am. (Whispers and hands her a card.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (glancing at the card). Oh! (Puts it in her pocket.)\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Is there anything wrong?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, no, not in the least. It is only something--it is my new\n",
      "dress--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. What? Your dress is lying there.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Oh, yes, that one; but this is another. I ordered it. Torvald\n",
      "mustn't know about it--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Oho! Then that was the great secret.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Of course. Just go in to him; he is sitting in the inner room.\n",
      "Keep him as long as--\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Make your mind easy; I won't let him escape.\n",
      "(Goes (Goes into HELMER'S room.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (to the MAID). And he is standing waiting in the kitchen?\n",
      "Maid. Maid. Yes; he came up the back stairs.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. But didn't you tell him no one was in?\n",
      "Maid. Maid. Yes, but it was no good.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. He won't go away?\n",
      "Maid. Maid. No; he says he won't until he has seen you, ma'am.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Well, let him come in--but quietly. Helen, you mustn't say\n",
      "anything about it to anyone. It is a surprise for my husband.\n",
      "Maid. Maid. Yes, ma'am, I quite understand. (Exit.)\n",
      "Nora. Nora. This dreadful thing is going to happen! It will happen in spite of\n",
      "me! No, no, no, it can't happen--it shan't happen! (She bolts the door\n",
      "of HELMER'S room. The MAID opens the hall door for KROGSTAD and shuts it\n",
      "after him. He is wearing a fur coat, high boots and a fur cap.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (advancing towards him). Speak low--my husband is at home.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. No matter about that.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do you want of me?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. An explanation of something.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Make haste then. What is it?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. You know, I suppose, that I have got my dismissal.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I couldn't prevent it, Mr. Krogstad. I fought as hard as I could\n",
      "on your side, but it was no good.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Does your husband love you so little, then? He knows what I\n",
      "can expose you to, and yet he ventures--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. How can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I didn't suppose so at all. It would not be the least like our\n",
      "dear Torvald Helmer to show so much courage--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Mr. Krogstad, a little respect for my husband, please.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Certainly--all the respect he deserves. But since you have\n",
      "kept the matter so carefully to yourself, I make bold to suppose that\n",
      "you have a little clearer idea, than you had yesterday, of what it\n",
      "actually is that you have done?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. More than you could ever teach me.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Yes, such a bad lawyer as I am.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What is it you want of me?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Only to see how you were, Mrs. Helmer. I have been thinking\n",
      "about you all day long. A mere cashier, a quill-driver, a--well, a man\n",
      "like me--even he has a little of what is called feeling, you know.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Show it, then; think of my little children.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Have you and your husband thought of mine? But never mind\n",
      "about that. I only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter\n",
      "too seriously. In the first place there will be no accusation made on my\n",
      "part.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, of course not; I was sure of that.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. The whole thing can be arranged amicably; there is no reason\n",
      "why anyone should know anything about it. It will remain a secret\n",
      "between us three.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. My husband must never get to know anything about it.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. How will you be able to prevent it? Am I to understand that\n",
      "you can pay the balance that is owing?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, not just at present.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the money\n",
      "soon?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No expedient that I mean to make use of.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Well, in any case, it would have been of no use to you now. If\n",
      "you stood there with ever so much money in your hand, I would never part\n",
      "with your bond.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Tell me what purpose you mean to put it to.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I shall only preserve it--keep it in my possession. No one who\n",
      "is not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it. So\n",
      "that if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It has.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. If you had it in your mind to run away from your home--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I had.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Or even something worse--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. How could you know that?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Give up the idea.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. How did you know I had thought of that?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Most of us think of that at first. I did, too--but I hadn't\n",
      "the courage.\n",
      "Nora Nora (faintly). No more had I.\n",
      "Krogstad Krogstad (in a tone of relief). No, that's it, isn't it--you hadn't the\n",
      "courage either?\n",

      "Krogstad. Krogstad. And do you know what they think of me here?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. You seemed to me to imply that with me you might have been\n",
      "quite another man.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I am certain of it.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Is it too late now?\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Christine, are you saying this deliberately? Yes, I am sure\n",
      "you are. I see it in your face. Have you really the courage, then--?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I want to be a mother to someone, and your children need\n",
      "a mother. We two need each other. Nils, I have faith in your real\n",
      "character--I can dare anything together with you.\n",
      "Krogstad Krogstad (grasps her hands). Thanks, thanks, Christine! Now I shall find\n",
      "a way to clear myself in the eyes of the world. Ah, but I forgot--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (listening). Hush! The Tarantella! Go, go!\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Why? What is it?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Do you hear them up there? When that is over, we may expect\n",
      "them back.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Yes, yes--I will go. But it is all no use. Of course you are\n",
      "not aware what steps I have taken in the matter of the Helmers.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, I know all about that.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. And in spite of that have you the courage to--?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. I understand very well to what lengths a man like you might\n",
      "be driven by despair.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. If I could only undo what I have done!\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. You cannot. Your letter is lying in the letter-box now.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Are you sure of that?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Quite sure, but--\n",
      "Krogstad Krogstad (with a searching look at her). Is that what it all\n",
      "means?--that you want to save your friend at any cost? Tell me frankly.\n",
      "Is that it?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Nils, a woman who has once sold herself for another's sake,\n",
      "doesn't do it a second time.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I will ask for my letter back.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No, no.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Yes, of course I will. I will wait here until Helmer comes; I\n",
      "will tell him he must give me my letter back--that it only concerns my\n",
      "dismissal--that he is not to read it--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. No, Nils, you must not recall your letter.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. But, tell me, wasn't it for that very purpose that you asked\n",
      "me to meet you here?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. In my first moment of fright, it was. But twenty-four hours\n",
      "have elapsed since then, and in that time I have witnessed incredible\n",
      "things in this house. Helmer must know all about it. This unhappy secret\n",
      "must be disclosed; they must have a complete understanding between them,\n",
      "which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. Very well, if you will take the responsibility. But there is\n",
      "one thing I can do in any case, and I shall do it at once.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (listening). You must be quick and go! The dance is over; we\n",
      "are not safe a moment longer.\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I will wait for you below.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, do. You must see me back to my door...\n",
      "Krogstad. Krogstad. I have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in my\n",
      "life! (Goes out through the outer door. The door between the room and\n",
      "the hall remains open.)\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (tidying up the room and laying her hat and cloak ready).\n",
      "What a difference! what a difference! Someone to work for and live\n",
      "for--a home to bring comfort into. That I will do, indeed. I wish they\n",
      "would be quick and come--(Listens.) Ah, there they are now. I must put\n",
      "on my things. (Takes up her hat and cloak. HELMER'S and NORA'S voices\n",
      "are heard outside; a key is turned, and HELMER brings NORA almost by\n",
      "force into the hall. She is in an Italian costume with a large black\n",
      "shawl around her; he is in evening dress, and a black domino which is\n",
      "flying open.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (hanging back in the doorway, and struggling with him). No, no,\n",
      "no!--don't take me in. I want to go upstairs again; I don't want to\n",
      "leave so early.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. But, my dearest Nora--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Please, Torvald dear--please, please--only an hour more.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Not a single minute, my sweet Nora. You know that was our\n",
      "agreement. Come along into the room; you are catching cold standing\n",
      "there. (He brings her gently into the room, in spite of her resistance.)\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Good evening.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Christine!\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You here, so late, Mrs. Linde?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, you must excuse me; I was so anxious to see Nora in her\n",
      "dress.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Have you been sitting here waiting for me?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, unfortunately I came too late, you had already gone\n",
      "upstairs; and I thought I couldn't go away again without having seen\n",
      "you.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (taking off NORA'S shawl). Yes, take a good look at her. I think\n",
      "she is worth looking at. Isn't she charming, Mrs. Linde?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, indeed she is.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Doesn't she look remarkably pretty? Everyone thought so at the\n",
      "dance. But she is terribly self-willed, this sweet little person. What\n",
      "are we to do with her? You will hardly believe that I had almost to\n",
      "bring her away by force.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Torvald, you will repent not having let me stay, even if it were\n",
      "only for half an hour.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Listen to her, Mrs. Linde! She had danced her Tarantella, and\n",
      "it had been a tremendous success, as it deserved--although possibly the\n",
      "performance was a trifle too realistic--a little more so, I mean, than\n",
      "was strictly compatible with the limitations of art. But never mind\n",
      "about that! The chief thing is, she had made a success--she had made\n",
      "a tremendous success. Do you think I was going to let her remain there\n",
      "after that, and spoil the effect? No, indeed! I took my charming little\n",
      "Capri maiden--my capricious little Capri maiden, I should say--on my\n",
      "arm; took one quick turn round the room; a curtsey on either side, and,\n",
      "as they say in novels, the beautiful apparition disappeared. An exit\n",
      "ought always to be effective, Mrs. Linde; but that is what I cannot make\n",
      "Nora understand. Pooh! this room is hot. (Throws his domino on a chair,\n",
      "and opens the door of his room.) Hullo! it's all dark in here. Oh, of\n",
      "course--excuse me--. (He goes in, and lights some candles.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (in a hurried and breathless whisper). Well?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (in a low voice). I have had a talk with him.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, and--\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Nora, you must tell your husband all about it.\n",
      "Nora Nora (in an expressionless voice). I knew it.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. You have nothing to be afraid of as far as Krogstad is\n",
      "concerned; but you must tell him.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I won't tell him.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Then the letter will.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Thank you, Christine. Now I know what I must do. Hush--!\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (coming in again). Well, Mrs. Linde, have you admired her?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, and now I will say goodnight.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What, already? Is this yours, this knitting?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde (taking it). Yes, thank you, I had very nearly forgotten it.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. So you knit?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Of course.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Do you know, you ought to embroider.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Really? Why?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes, it's far more becoming. Let me show you. You hold\n",
      "the embroidery thus in your left hand, and use the needle with the\n",
      "right--like this--with a long, easy sweep. Do you see?\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Yes, perhaps--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. But in the case of knitting--that can never be anything but\n",
      "ungraceful; look here--the arms close together, the knitting-needles\n",
      "going up and down--it has a sort of Chinese effect--. That was really\n",
      "excellent champagne they gave us.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Well,--goodnight, Nora, and don't be self-willed any more.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. That's right, Mrs. Linde.\n",
      "Mrs. Mrs. Linde. Goodnight, Mr. Helmer.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (accompanying her to the door). Goodnight, goodnight. I hope you\n",
      "will get home all right. I should be very happy to--but you haven't any\n",
      "great distance to go. Goodnight, goodnight. (She goes out; he shuts the\n",
      "door after her, and comes in again.) Ah!--at last we have got rid of\n",
      "her. She is a frightful bore, that woman.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Aren't you very tired, Torvald?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. No, not in the least.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Nor sleepy?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Not a bit. On the contrary, I feel extraordinarily lively. And\n",
      "you?--you really look both tired and sleepy.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, I am very tired. I want to go to sleep at once.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. There, you see it was quite right of me not to let you stay\n",
      "there any longer.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Everything you do is quite right, Torvald.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (kissing her on the forehead). Now my little skylark is speaking\n",
      "reasonably. Did you notice what good spirits Rank was in this evening?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Really? Was he? I didn't speak to him at all.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And I very little, but I have not for a long time seen him in\n",
      "such good form. (Looks for a while at her and then goes nearer to her.)\n",
      "It is delightful to be at home by ourselves again, to be all alone with\n",
      "you--you fascinating, charming little darling!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Don't look at me like that, Torvald.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Why shouldn't I look at my dearest treasure?--at all the beauty\n",
      "that is mine, all my very own?\n",
      "Nora Nora (going to the other side of the table). You mustn't say things like\n",
      "that to me tonight.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (following her). You have still got the Tarantella in your blood,\n",
      "I see. And it makes you more captivating than ever. Listen--the guests\n",
      "are beginning to go now. (In a lower voice.) Nora--soon the whole house\n",
      "will be quiet.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, I hope so.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes, my own darling Nora. Do you know, when I am out at a party\n",
      "with you like this, why I speak so little to you, keep away from you,\n",
      "and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then?--do you\n",
      "know why I do that? It is because I make believe to myself that we are\n",
      "secretly in love, and you are my secretly promised bride, and that no\n",
      "one suspects there is anything between us.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, yes--I know very well your thoughts are with me all the time.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And when we are leaving, and I am putting the shawl over your\n",
      "beautiful young shoulders--on your lovely neck--then I imagine that you\n",
      "are my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding, and I am\n",
      "bringing you for the first time into our home--to be alone with you for\n",
      "the first time--quite alone with my shy little darling! All this evening\n",
      "I have longed for nothing but you. When I watched the seductive figures\n",
      "of the Tarantella, my blood was on fire; I could endure it no longer,\n",
      "and that was why I brought you down so early--\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Go away, Torvald! You must let me go. I won't--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What's that? You're joking, my little Nora! You won't--you\n",
      "won't? Am I not your husband--? (A knock is heard at the outer door.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (starting). Did you hear--?\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (going into the hall). Who is it?\n",
      "Rank Rank (outside). It is I. May I come in for a moment?\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (in a fretful whisper). Oh, what does he want now? (Aloud.) Wait\n",
      "a minute! (Unlocks the door.) Come, that's kind of you not to pass by\n",
      "our door.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. I thought I heard your voice, and felt as if I should like to look\n",
      "in. (With a swift glance round.) Ah, yes!--these dear familiar rooms.\n",
      "You are very happy and cosy in here, you two.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. It seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty well\n",
      "upstairs too.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Excellently. Why shouldn't I? Why shouldn't one enjoy everything\n",
      "in this world?--at any rate as much as one can, and as long as one can.\n",
      "The wine was capital--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Especially the champagne.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. So you noticed that too? It is almost incredible how much I\n",
      "managed to put away!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight too.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Did he?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, and he is always in such good spirits afterwards.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Well, why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well-spent\n",
      "day?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Well spent? I am afraid I can't take credit for that.\n",
      "Rank Rank (clapping him on the back). But I can, you know!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Doctor Rank, you must have been occupied with some scientific\n",
      "investigation today.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Exactly.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Just listen!--little Nora talking about scientific\n",
      "investigations!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And may I congratulate you on the result?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Indeed you may.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Was it favourable, then?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. The best possible, for both doctor and patient--certainty.\n",
      "Nora Nora (quickly and searchingly). Certainty?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Absolute certainty. So wasn't I entitled to make a merry evening\n",
      "of it after that?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, you certainly were, Doctor Rank. Helmer. I think so too, so\n",
      "long as you don't have to pay for it in the morning.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Oh well, one can't have anything in this life without paying for\n",
      "it.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Doctor Rank--are you fond of fancy-dress balls?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, if there is a fine lot of pretty costumes.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Tell me--what shall we two wear at the next?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Little featherbrain!--are you thinking of the next already?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. We two? Yes, I can tell you. You shall go as a good fairy--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes, but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Let your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. That was really very prettily turned. But can't you tell us what\n",
      "you will be?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Yes, my dear friend, I have quite made up my mind about that.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Well?\n",
      "Rank. Rank. At the next fancy-dress ball I shall be invisible.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. That's a good joke!\n",
      "Rank. Rank. There is a big black hat--have you never heard of hats that make\n",
      "you invisible? If you put one on, no one can see you.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (suppressing a smile). Yes, you are quite right.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. But I am clean forgetting what I came for. Helmer, give me a\n",
      "cigar--one of the dark Havanas.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. With the greatest pleasure. (Offers him his case.)\n",
      "Rank Rank (takes a cigar and cuts off the end). Thanks.\n",
      "Nora Nora (striking a match). Let me give you a light.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Thank you. (She holds the match for him to light his cigar.) And\n",
      "now goodbye!\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Goodbye, goodbye, dear old man!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Sleep well, Doctor Rank.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. Thank you for that wish.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Wish me the same.\n",
      "Rank. Rank. You? Well, if you want me to sleep well! And thanks for the light.\n",
      "(He nods to them both and goes out.)\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (in a subdued voice). He has drunk more than he ought.\n",
      "Nora Nora (absently). Maybe. (HELMER takes a bunch of keys out of his pocket\n",
      "and goes into the hall.) Torvald! what are you going to do there?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Emptying the letter-box; it is quite full; there will be no room\n",
      "to put the newspaper in tomorrow morning.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Are you going to work tonight?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You know quite well I'm not. What is this? Someone has been at\n",
      "the lock.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. At the lock--?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes, someone has. What can it mean? I should never have thought\n",
      "the maid--. Here is a broken hairpin. Nora, it is one of yours.\n",
      "Nora Nora (quickly). Then it must have been the children--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Then you must get them out of those ways. There, at last I have\n",
      "got it open. (Takes out the contents of the letter-box, and calls to the\n",
      "kitchen.) Helen!--Helen, put out the light over the front door. (Goes\n",
      "back into the room and shuts the door into the hall. He holds out his\n",
      "hand full of letters.) Look at that--look what a heap of them there\n",
      "are. (Turning them over.) What on earth is that?\n",
      "Nora Nora (at the window). The letter--No! Torvald, no!\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Two cards--of Rank's.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Of Doctor Rank's?\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (looking at them). Doctor Rank. They were on the top. He must\n",
      "have put them in when he went out.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Is there anything written on them?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. There is a black cross over the name. Look there--what an\n",
      "uncomfortable idea! It looks as if he were announcing his own death.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It is just what he is doing.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What? Do you know anything about it? Has he said anything to\n",
      "you?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes. He told me that when the cards came it would be his\n",
      "leave-taking from us. He means to shut himself up and die.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. My poor old friend! Certainly I knew we should not have him very\n",
      "long with us. But so soon! And so he hides himself away like a wounded\n",
      "animal.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. If it has to happen, it is best it should be without a word--don't\n",
      "you think so, Torvald?\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (walking up and down). He had so grown into our lives. I can't\n",
      "think of him as having gone out of them. He, with his sufferings and his\n",
      "loneliness, was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness. Well,\n",
      "perhaps it is best so. For him, anyway. (Standing still.) And perhaps\n",
      "for us too, Nora. We two are thrown quite upon each other now. (Puts his\n",
      "arms round her.) My darling wife, I don't feel as if I could hold you\n",
      "tight enough. Do you know, Nora, I have often wished that you might be\n",
      "threatened by some great danger, so that I might risk my life's blood,\n",
      "and everything, for your sake.\n",
      "Nora Nora (disengages herself, and says firmly and decidedly). Now you must\n",
      "read your letters, Torvald.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. No, no; not tonight. I want to be with you, my darling wife.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. With the thought of your friend's death--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You are right, it has affected us both. Something ugly has come\n",
      "between us--the thought of the horrors of death. We must try and rid our\n",
      "minds of that. Until then--we will each go to our own room.\n",
      "Nora Nora (hanging on his neck). Goodnight, Torvald--Goodnight!\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (kissing her on the forehead). Goodnight, my little singing-bird.\n",
      "Sleep sound, Nora. Now I will read my letters through. (He takes his\n",
      "letters and goes into his room, shutting the door after him.)\n",
      "Nora Nora (gropes distractedly about, seizes HELMER'S domino, throws it round\n",
      "her, while she says in quick, hoarse, spasmodic whispers). Never to see\n",
      "him again. Never! Never! (Puts her shawl over her head.) Never to see\n",
      "my children again either--never again. Never! Never!--Ah! the icy, black\n",
      "water--the unfathomable depths--If only it were over! He has got it\n",
      "now--now he is reading it. Goodbye, Torvald and my children! (She is\n",
      "about to rush out through the hall, when HELMER opens his door hurriedly\n",
      "and stands with an open letter in his hand.)\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Ah!--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What is this? Do you know what is in this letter?\n",

      "Helmer Helmer (holding her back). Where are you going?\n",
      "Nora Nora (trying to get free). You shan't save me, Torvald!\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (reeling). True? Is this true, that I read here? Horrible! No,\n",
      "no--it is impossible that it can be true.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It is true. I have loved you above everything else in the world.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Oh, don't let us have any silly excuses.\n",
      "Nora Nora (taking a step towards him). Torvald--!\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Miserable creature--what have you done?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Let me go. You shall not suffer for my sake. You shall not take it\n",
      "upon yourself.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. No tragic airs, please. (Locks the hall door.) Here you shall\n",
      "stay and give me an explanation. Do you understand what you have done?\n",
      "Answer me! Do you understand what you have done?\n",
      "Nora Nora (looks steadily at him and says with a growing look of coldness in\n",
      "her face). Yes, now I am beginning to understand thoroughly.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (walking about the room). What a horrible awakening! All these\n",
      "eight years--she who was my joy and pride--a hypocrite, a liar--worse,\n",
      "worse--a criminal! The unutterable ugliness of it all!--For shame! For\n",
      "shame! (NORA is silent and looks steadily at him. He stops in front of\n",
      "her.) I ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen.\n",
      "I ought to have foreseen it. All your father's want of principle--be\n",
      "silent!--all your father's want of principle has come out in you. No\n",
      "religion, no morality, no sense of duty--. How I am punished for having\n",
      "winked at what he did! I did it for your sake, and this is how you repay\n",
      "me.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, that's just it.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Now you have destroyed all my happiness. You have ruined all my\n",
      "future. It is horrible to think of! I am in the power of an unscrupulous\n",
      "man; he can do what he likes with me, ask anything he likes of me, give\n",
      "me any orders he pleases--I dare not refuse. And I must sink to such\n",
      "miserable depths because of a thoughtless woman!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. When I am out of the way, you will be free.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. No fine speeches, please. Your father had always plenty of those\n",
      "ready, too. What good would it be to me if you were out of the way, as\n",
      "you say? Not the slightest. He can make the affair known everywhere; and\n",
      "if he does, I may be falsely suspected of having been a party to your\n",
      "criminal action. Very likely people will think I was behind it all--that\n",
      "it was I who prompted you! And I have to thank you for all this--you\n",
      "whom I have cherished during the whole of our married life. Do you\n",
      "understand now what it is you have done for me?\n",
      "Nora Nora (coldly and quietly). Yes.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. It is so incredible that I can't take it in. But we must come to\n",
      "some understanding. Take off that shawl. Take it off, I tell you. I must\n",
      "try and appease him some way or another. The matter must be hushed up at\n",
      "any cost. And as for you and me, it must appear as if everything between\n",
      "us were just as before--but naturally only in the eyes of the world. You\n",
      "will still remain in my house, that is a matter of course. But I shall\n",
      "not allow you to bring up the children; I dare not trust them to you.\n",
      "To think that I should be obliged to say so to one whom I have loved\n",
      "so dearly, and whom I still--. No, that is all over. From this moment\n",
      "happiness is not the question; all that concerns us is to save the\n",
      "remains, the fragments, the appearance--\n",

      "Helmer. Helmer. Give it to me. (Takes the letter, and shuts the door.) Yes, it\n",
      "is from him. You shall not have it; I will read it myself.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, read it.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (standing by the lamp). I scarcely have the courage to do it. It\n",
      "may mean ruin for both of us. No, I must know. (Tears open the letter,\n",

      "shout of joy.) Nora! (She looks at him questioningly.) Nora!--No, I must\n",

      "can do anything to you. Oh, Nora, Nora!--no, first I must destroy these\n",
      "hateful things. Let me see--. (Takes a look at the bond.) No, no, I\n",
      "won't look at it. The whole thing shall be nothing but a bad dream to\n",
      "me. (Tears up the bond and both letters, throws them all into the stove,\n",
      "and watches them burn.) There--now it doesn't exist any longer. He says\n",

      "could believe that I have forgiven you. But it is true, Nora, I swear\n",
      "it; I have forgiven you everything. I know that what you did, you did\n",
      "out of love for me.\n",

      "had not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used. But do you\n",
      "suppose you are any the less dear to me, because you don't understand\n",
      "how to act on your own responsibility? No, no; only lean on me; I\n",
      "will advise you and direct you. I should not be a man if this womanly\n",
      "helplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes.\n",
      "You must not think anymore about the hard things I said in my first\n",

      "overwhelm me. I have forgiven you, Nora; I swear to you I have forgiven\n",
      "you.\n",

      "the right.)\n",

      "Nora Nora (from within). Taking off my fancy dress.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (standing at the open door). Yes, do. Try and calm yourself,\n",
      "and make your mind easy again, my frightened little singing-bird. Be at\n",
      "rest, and feel secure; I have broad wings to shelter you under. (Walks\n",
      "up and down by the door.) How warm and cosy our home is, Nora. Here is\n",
      "shelter for you; here I will protect you like a hunted dove that I\n",
      "have saved from a hawk's claws; I will bring peace to your poor beating\n",
      "heart. It will come, little by little, Nora, believe me. Tomorrow\n",
      "morning you will look upon it all quite differently; soon everything\n",
      "will be just as it was before. Very soon you won't need me to assure you\n",
      "that I have forgiven you; you will yourself feel the certainty that I\n",
      "have done so. Can you suppose I should ever think of such a thing as\n",
      "repudiating you, or even reproaching you? You have no idea what a true\n",
      "man's heart is like, Nora. There is something so indescribably sweet\n",
      "and satisfying, to a man, in the knowledge that he has forgiven his\n",
      "wife--forgiven her freely, and with all his heart. It seems as if that\n",
      "had made her, as it were, doubly his own; he has given her a new life,\n",
      "so to speak; and she has in a way become both wife and child to him. So\n",
      "you shall be for me after this, my little scared, helpless darling. Have\n",
      "no anxiety about anything, Nora; only be frank and open with me, and I\n",
      "will serve as will and conscience both to you--. What is this? Not gone\n",
      "to bed? Have you changed your things?\n",
      "Nora Nora (in everyday dress). Yes, Torvald, I have changed my things now.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. But what for?--so late as this.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I shall not sleep tonight.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. But, my dear Nora--\n",
      "Nora Nora (looking at her watch). It is not so very late. Sit down here,\n",
      "Torvald. You and I have much to say to one another. (She sits down at\n",
      "one side of the table.)\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora--what is this?--this cold, set face?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Sit down. It will take some time; I have a lot to talk over with\n",
      "you.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (sits down at the opposite side of the table). You alarm me,\n",
      "Nora!--and I don't understand you.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, that is just it. You don't understand me, and I have never\n",
      "understood you either--before tonight. No, you mustn't interrupt me.\n",
      "You must simply listen to what I say. Torvald, this is a settling of\n",
      "accounts.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What do you mean by that?\n",
      "Nora Nora (after a short silence). Isn't there one thing that strikes you as\n",
      "strange in our sitting here like this?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What is that?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. We have been married now eight years. Does it not occur to you\n",
      "that this is the first time we two, you and I, husband and wife, have\n",
      "had a serious conversation?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What do you mean by serious?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. In all these eight years--longer than that--from the very\n",
      "beginning of our acquaintance, we have never exchanged a word on any\n",
      "serious subject.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Was it likely that I would be continually and forever telling\n",
      "you about worries that you could not help me to bear?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I am not speaking about business matters. I say that we have never\n",
      "sat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. But, dearest Nora, would it have been any good to you?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. That is just it; you have never understood me. I have been greatly\n",
      "wronged, Torvald--first by papa and then by you.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What! By us two--by us two, who have loved you better than\n",
      "anyone else in the world?\n",
      "Nora Nora (shaking her head). You have never loved me. You have only thought\n",
      "it pleasant to be in love with me.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora, what do I hear you saying?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It is perfectly true, Torvald. When I was at home with papa, he\n",
      "told me his opinion about everything, and so I had the same opinions;\n",
      "and if I differed from him I concealed the fact, because he would not\n",
      "have liked it. He called me his doll-child, and he played with me just\n",
      "as I used to play with my dolls. And when I came to live with you--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage?\n",
      "Nora Nora (undisturbed). I mean that I was simply transferred from papa's\n",
      "hands into yours. You arranged everything according to your own taste,\n",
      "and so I got the same tastes as your else I pretended to, I am really\n",
      "not quite sure which--I think sometimes the one and sometimes the other.\n",
      "When I look back on it, it seems to me as if I had been living here like\n",
      "a poor woman--just from hand to mouth. I have existed merely to perform\n",
      "tricks for you, Torvald. But you would have it so. You and papa have\n",
      "committed a great sin against me. It is your fault that I have made\n",
      "nothing of my life.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. How unreasonable and how ungrateful you are, Nora! Have you not\n",
      "been happy here?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, I have never been happy. I thought I was, but it has never\n",
      "really been so.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Not--not happy!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, only merry. And you have always been so kind to me. But our\n",
      "home has been nothing but a playroom. I have been your doll-wife, just\n",
      "as at home I was papa's doll-child; and here the children have been\n",
      "my dolls. I thought it great fun when you played with me, just as they\n",
      "thought it great fun when I played with them. That is what our marriage\n",
      "has been, Torvald.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. There is some truth in what you say--exaggerated and strained as\n",
      "your view of it is. But for the future it shall be different. Playtime\n",
      "shall be over, and lesson-time shall begin.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Whose lessons? Mine, or the children's?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Both yours and the children's, my darling Nora.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Alas, Torvald, you are not the man to educate me into being a\n",
      "proper wife for you.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And you can say that!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. And I--how am I fitted to bring up the children?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Didn't you say so yourself a little while ago--that you dare not\n",
      "trust me to bring them up?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. In a moment of anger! Why do you pay any heed to that?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Indeed, you were perfectly right. I am not fit for the task.\n",
      "There is another task I must undertake first. I must try and educate\n",
      "myself--you are not the man to help me in that. I must do that for\n",
      "myself. And that is why I am going to leave you now.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (springing up). What do you say?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I must stand quite alone, if I am to understand myself and\n",
      "everything about me. It is for that reason that I cannot remain with you\n",
      "any longer.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora, Nora!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I am going away from here now, at once. I am sure Christine will\n",
      "take me in for the night--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You are out of your mind! I won't allow it! I forbid you!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It is no use forbidding me anything any longer. I will take with\n",
      "me what belongs to myself. I will take nothing from you, either now or\n",
      "later.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What sort of madness is this!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Tomorrow I shall go home--I mean, to my old home. It will be\n",
      "easiest for me to find something to do there.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You blind, foolish woman!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I must try and get some sense, Torvald.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. To desert your home, your husband and your children! And you\n",
      "don't consider what people will say!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I cannot consider that at all. I only know that it is necessary\n",
      "for me.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. It's shocking. This is how you would neglect your most sacred\n",
      "duties.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What do you consider my most sacred duties?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Do I need to tell you that? Are they not your duties to your\n",
      "husband and your children?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I have other duties just as sacred.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. That you have not. What duties could those be?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Duties to myself.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Before all else, you are a wife and a mother.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I don't believe that any longer. I believe that before all else I\n",
      "am a reasonable human being, just as you are--or, at all events, that\n",
      "I must try and become one. I know quite well, Torvald, that most people\n",
      "would think you right, and that views of that kind are to be found in\n",
      "books; but I can no longer content myself with what most people say, or\n",
      "with what is found in books. I must think over things for myself and get\n",
      "to understand them.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Can you not understand your place in your own home? Have you not\n",
      "a reliable guide in such matters as that?--have you no religion?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I am afraid, Torvald, I do not exactly know what religion is.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. What are you saying?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I know nothing but what the clergyman said, when I went to be\n",
      "confirmed. He told us that religion was this, and that, and the other.\n",
      "When I am away from all this, and am alone, I will look into that matter\n",
      "too. I will see if what the clergyman said is true, or at all events if\n",
      "it is true for me.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. This is unheard of in a girl of your age! But if religion cannot\n",
      "lead you aright, let me try and awaken your conscience. I suppose you\n",
      "have some moral sense? Or--answer me--am I to think you have none?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I assure you, Torvald, that is not an easy question to answer. I\n",
      "really don't know. The thing perplexes me altogether. I only know that\n",
      "you and I look at it in quite a different light. I am learning, too,\n",
      "that the law is quite another thing from what I supposed; but I find it\n",
      "impossible to convince myself that the law is right. According to it\n",
      "a woman has no right to spare her old dying father, or to save her\n",
      "husband's life. I can't believe that.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You talk like a child. You don't understand the conditions of\n",
      "the world in which you live.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, I don't. But now I am going to try. I am going to see if I can\n",
      "make out who is right, the world or I.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You are ill, Nora; you are delirious; I almost think you are out\n",
      "of your mind.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your\n",
      "husband and your children?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, it is.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Then there is only one possible explanation.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. What is that?\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. You do not love me anymore.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. No, that is just it.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora!--and you can say that?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It gives me great pain, Torvald, for you have always been so kind\n",
      "to me, but I cannot help it. I do not love you any more.\n",
      "Helmer Helmer (regaining his composure). Is that a clear and certain conviction\n",
      "too?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, absolutely clear and certain. That is the reason why I will\n",
      "not stay here any longer.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. And can you tell me what I have done to forfeit your love?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Yes, indeed I can. It was tonight, when the wonderful thing did\n",
      "not happen; then I saw you were not the man I had thought you were.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Explain yourself better. I don't understand you.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. I have waited so patiently for eight years; for, goodness knows,\n",
      "I knew very well that wonderful things don't happen every day. Then this\n",
      "horrible misfortune came upon me; and then I felt quite certain that the\n",
      "wonderful thing was going to happen at last. When Krogstad's letter was\n",
      "lying out there, never for a moment did I imagine that you would consent\n",
      "to accept this man's conditions. I was so absolutely certain that you\n",
      "would say to him: Publish the thing to the whole world. And when that\n",
      "was done--\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Yes, what then?--when I had exposed my wife to shame and\n",
      "disgrace?\n",
      "Nora. Nora. When that was done, I was so absolutely certain, you would come\n",
      "forward and take everything upon yourself, and say: I am the guilty one.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Nora--!\n",
      "Nora. Nora. You mean that I would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your\n",
      "part? No, of course not. But what would my assurances have been worth\n",
      "against yours? That was the wonderful thing which I hoped for and\n",
      "feared; and it was to prevent that, that I wanted to kill myself.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. I would gladly work night and day for you, Nora--bear sorrow and\n",
      "want for your sake. But no man would sacrifice his honour for the one he\n",
      "loves.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. It is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done.\n",
      "Helmer. Helmer. Oh, you think and talk like a heedless child.\n",
      "Nora. Nora. Maybe. But you neither think nor talk like the man I could bind\n",
      "myself to. As soon as your fear was over--and it was not fear for what\n",
      "threatened me, but for what might happen to you--when the whole thing\n",
      "was past, as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at\n",
      "all had happened. Exactly as before, I was your little skylark, your\n",
      "doll, which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care, because\n",
      "it was so brittle and fragile. (Getting up.) Torvald--it was then\n",
      "it dawned upon me that for eight years I had been living here with a\n",
      "strange man, and had borne him three children--. Oh, I can't bear to\n",
