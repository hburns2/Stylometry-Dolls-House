helmer ,helmer  still  you know  we can t spend money recklessly  nora  yes torvald  we may be a wee bit more reckless now  mayn t we  just a tinywee bit  you are going to have a big salary and earn lots and lots ofmoney
helmer ,helmer  yes  after the new year  but then it will be a whole quarterbefore the salary is due
nora ,nora  pooh  we can borrow until then
helmer ,helmer  nora   thesame little featherhead  suppose  now  that i borrowed fifty poundstoday  and you spent it all in the christmas week  and then on newyear s eve a slate fell on my head and killed me  and  nora   oh  don t say such horrid things
helmer ,helmer  still  suppose that happened   what then
nora ,nora  if that were to happen  i don t suppose i should care whether iowed money or not
helmer ,helmer  yes  but what about the people who had lent it
nora ,nora  they  who would bother about them  i should not know who theywere
helmer ,helmer  that is like a woman  but seriously  nora  you know what i thinkabout that  no debt  no borrowing  there can be no freedom or beautyabout a home life that depends on borrowing and debt  we two have keptbravely on the straight road so far  and we will go on the same way forthe short time longer that there need be any struggle
nora ,nora   as you please  torvald
helmer ,helmer   come  come  my little skylark must not droop herwings  what is this  is my little squirrel out of temper   nora  what do you think i have got here

nora ,nora   ten shillings  a pound  two pounds  thank you  thankyou  torvald  that will keep me going for a long time
helmer ,helmer  indeed it must
nora ,nora  yes  yes  it will  but come here and let me show you what i havebought  and all so cheap  look  here is a new suit for ivar  anda sword  and a horse and a trumpet for bob  and a doll and dolly sbedstead for emmy   they are very plain  but anyway she will soon breakthem in pieces  and here are dress lengths and handkerchiefs for themaids  old anne ought really to have something better
helmer ,helmer  and what is in this parcel
nora ,nora   no  no  you mustn t see that until this evening
helmer ,helmer  very well  but now tell me  you extravagant little person  whatwould you like for yourself
nora ,nora  for myself  oh  i am sure i don t want anything
helmer ,helmer  yes  but you must  tell me something reasonable that you wouldparticularly like to have
nora ,nora  no  i really can t think of anything  unless  torvald
helmer ,helmer  well
nora ,nora   if you really want to give me something  you might  you might
helmer ,helmer  well  out with it
nora ,nora   you might give me money  torvald  only just asmuch as you can afford  and then one of these days i will buy somethingwith it
helmer ,helmer  but  nora
nora ,nora  oh  do  dear torvald  please  please do  then i will wrap it up inbeautiful gilt paper and hang it on the christmas tree  wouldn t that befun
helmer ,helmer  what are little people called that are always wasting money
nora ,nora  spendthrifts  i know  let us do as you suggest  torvald  and theni shall have time to think what i am most in want of  that is a verysensible plan  isn t it
helmer ,helmer   indeed it is  that is to say  if you were really tosave out of the money i give you  and then really buy something foryourself  but if you spend it all on the housekeeping and any number ofunnecessary things  then i merely have to pay up again
nora ,nora  oh but  torvald
helmer ,helmer  you can t deny it  my dear little nora   it s a sweet little spendthrift  but she uses up a deal ofmoney  one would hardly believe how expensive such little persons are
nora ,nora  it s a shame to say that  i do really save all i can
helmer ,helmer   that s very true   all you can  but you can t saveanything
nora ,nora   you haven t any idea how manyexpenses we skylarks and squirrels have  torvald
helmer ,helmer  you are an odd little soul  very like your father  you alwaysfind some new way of wheedling money out of me  and  as soon as youhave got it  it seems to melt in your hands  you never know where ithas gone  still  one must take you as you are  it is in the blood  forindeed it is true that you can inherit these things  nora
nora ,nora  ah  i wish i had inherited many of papa s qualities
helmer ,helmer  and i would not wish you to be anything but just what you are my sweet little skylark  but  do you know  it strikes me that you arelooking rather  what shall i say  rather uneasy today
nora ,nora  do i
helmer ,helmer  you do  really  look straight at me
nora ,nora   well
helmer ,helmer   hasn t miss sweet tooth beenbreaking rules in town today
nora ,nora  no  what makes you think that
helmer ,helmer  hasn t she paid a visit to the confectioner s
nora ,nora  no  i assure you  torvald
helmer ,helmer  not been nibbling sweets
nora ,nora  no  certainly not
helmer ,helmer  not even taken a bite at a macaroon or two
nora ,nora  no  torvald  i assure you really
helmer ,helmer  there  there  of course i was only joking
nora ,nora   i should not think of goingagainst your wishes
helmer ,helmer  no  i am sure of that  besides  you gave me your word    keep your little christmas secrets to yourself  my darling they will all be revealed tonight when the christmas tree is lit  nodoubt
nora ,nora  did you remember to invite doctor rank
helmer ,helmer  no  but there is no need  as a matter of course he will come todinner with us  however  i will ask him when he comes in this morning i have ordered some good wine  nora  you can t think how i am lookingforward to this evening
nora ,nora  so am i  and how the children will enjoy themselves  torvald
helmer ,helmer  it is splendid to feel that one has a perfectly safeappointment  and a big enough income  it s delightful to think of  isn tit
nora ,nora  it s wonderful
helmer ,helmer  do you remember last christmas  for a full three weeksbeforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight making ornaments for the christmas tree  and all the other fine thingsthat were to be a surprise to us  it was the dullest three weeks i everspent
nora ,nora  i didn t find it dull
helmer ,helmer   but there was precious little result  nora
nora ,nora  oh  you shouldn t tease me about that again  how could i help thecat s going in and tearing everything to pieces
helmer ,helmer  of course you couldn t  poor little girl  you had the best ofintentions to please us all  and that s the main thing  but it is a goodthing that our hard times are over
nora ,nora  yes  it is really wonderful
helmer ,helmer  this time i needn t sit here and be dull all alone  and youneedn t ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands
nora ,nora   no  torvald  i needn t any longer  need i it s wonderfully lovely to hear you say so   now i willtell you how i have been thinking we ought to arrange things  torvald as soon as christmas is over   there s thebell   there s some one at the door  whata nuisance
helmer ,helmer  if it is a caller  remember i am not at home
maid ,maid   a lady to see you  ma am   a stranger
nora ,nora  ask her to come in
maid ,maid   the doctor came at the same time  sir
helmer ,helmer  did he go straight into my room
maid ,maid  yes  sir
mrs ,mrs  linde   how do you do  nora
nora ,nora   how do you do  mrs  linde  you don t recognise me  isuppose
nora ,nora  no  i don t know  yes  to be sure  i seem to   yes christine  is it really you
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  it is i
nora ,nora  christine  to think of my not recognising you  and yet how couldi   how you have altered  christine
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  i have indeed  in nine  ten long years
nora ,nora  is it so long since we met  i suppose it is  the last eight yearshave been a happy time for me  i can tell you  and so now you have comeinto the town  and have taken this long journey in winter  that wasplucky of you
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i arrived by steamer this morning
nora ,nora  to have some fun at christmas time  of course  how delightful  wewill have such fun together  but take off your things  you are not cold i hope   now we will sit down by the stove  and be cosy no  take this armchair  i will sit here in the rocking chair   now you look like your old self again  it was only the firstmoment  you are a little paler  christine  and perhaps a little thinner
mrslinde ,mrslinde  and much  much older  nora
nora ,nora  perhaps a little older  very  very little  certainly not much  what a thoughtless creature i am chattering away like this  my poor  dear christine  do forgive me
mrslinde ,mrslinde  what do you mean  nora
nora ,nora   poor christine  you are a widow
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  it is three years ago now
nora ,nora  yes  i knew  i saw it in the papers  i assure you  christine  imeant ever so often to write to you at the time  but i always put it offand something always prevented me
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i quite understand  dear
nora ,nora  it was very bad of me  christine  poor thing  how you must havesuffered  and he left you nothing
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no
nora ,nora  and no children
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no
nora ,nora  nothing at all  then
mrslinde ,mrslinde  not even any sorrow or grief to live upon
nora ,nora   but  christine  is that possible
mrs ,mrs  linde   it sometimes happens nora
nora ,nora  so you are quite alone  how dreadfully sad that must be  i havethree lovely children  you can t see them just now  for they are outwith their nurse  but now you must tell me all about it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  no  i want to hear about you
nora ,nora  no  you must begin  i mustn t be selfish today  today i must onlythink of your affairs  but there is one thing i must tell you  do youknow we have just had a great piece of good luck
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  what is it
nora ,nora  just fancy  my husband has been made manager of the bank
mrslinde ,mrslinde  your husband  what good luck
nora ,nora  yes  tremendous  a barrister s profession is such an uncertainthing  especially if he won t undertake unsavoury cases  and naturallytorvald has never been willing to do that  and i quite agree with him you may imagine how pleased we are  he is to take up his work in thebank at the new year  and then he will have a big salary and lots ofcommissions  for the future we can live quite differently  we can dojust as we like  i feel so relieved and so happy  christine  it will besplendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety  won tit
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  anyhow i think it would be delightful to have what oneneeds
nora ,nora  no  not only what one needs  but heaps and heaps of money
mrs ,mrs  linde   nora  nora  haven t you learned sense yet  in ourschooldays you were a great spendthrift
nora ,nora   yes  that is what torvald says now   but  nora  nora  is not so silly as you think  we have not been ina position for me to waste money  we have both had to work
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you too
nora ,nora  yes  odds and ends  needlework  crotchet work  embroidery  andthat kind of thing   and other things as well  youknow torvald left his office when we were married  there was no prospectof promotion there  and he had to try and earn more than before  butduring the first year he over worked himself dreadfully  you see  he hadto make money every way he could  and he worked early and late  but hecouldn t stand it  and fell dreadfully ill  and the doctors said it wasnecessary for him to go south
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you spent a whole year in italy  didn t you
nora ,nora  yes  it was no easy matter to get away  i can tell you  itwas just after ivar was born  but naturally we had to go  it was awonderfully beautiful journey  and it saved torvald s life  but it costa tremendous lot of money  christine
mrslinde ,mrslinde  so i should think
nora ,nora  it cost about two hundred and fifty pounds  that s a lot  isn tit
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have themoney
nora ,nora  i ought to tell you that we had it from papa
mrslinde ,mrslinde  oh  i see  it was just about that time that he died  wasn tit
nora ,nora  yes  and  just think of it  i couldn t go and nurse him  i wasexpecting little ivar s birth every day and i had my poor sick torvaldto look after  my dear  kind father  i never saw him again  christine that was the saddest time i have known since our marriage
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i know how fond you were of him  and then you went off toitaly
nora ,nora  yes  you see we had money then  and the doctors insisted on ourgoing  so we started a month later
mrslinde ,mrslinde  and your husband came back quite well
nora ,nora  as sound as a bell
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but  the doctor
nora ,nora  what doctor
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here justas i did  was the doctor
nora ,nora  yes  that was doctor rank  but he doesn t come hereprofessionally  he is our greatest friend  and comes in at least onceevery day  no  torvald has not had an hour s illness since then  and ourchildren are strong and healthy and so am i   christine  christine  it s good to be alive and happy   but howhorrid of me  i am talking of nothing but my own affairs   you mustn t be angrywith me  tell me  is it really true that you did not love your husband why did you marry him
mrslinde ,mrslinde  my mother was alive then  and was bedridden and helpless and i had to provide for my two younger brothers  so i did not think iwas justified in refusing his offer
nora ,nora  no  perhaps you were quite right  he was rich at that time  then
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i believe he was quite well off  but his business was aprecarious one  and  when he died  it all went to pieces and there wasnothing left
nora ,nora  and then
mrslinde ,mrslinde  well  i had to turn my hand to anything i could find  firsta small shop  then a small school  and so on  the last three years haveseemed like one long working day  with no rest  now it is at an end nora  my poor mother needs me no more  for she is gone  and the boysdo not need me either  they have got situations and can shift forthemselves
nora ,nora  what a relief you must feel if
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  indeed  i only feel my life unspeakably empty  no one tolive for anymore   that was why i could not standthe life in my little backwater any longer  i hope it may be easier hereto find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts  if only icould have the good luck to get some regular work  office work of somekind
nora ,nora  but  christine  that is so frightfully tiring  and you look tiredout now  you had far better go away to some watering place
mrs ,mrs  linde   i have no father to give me moneyfor a journey  nora
nora ,nora   oh  don t be angry with me
mrs ,mrs  linde   it is you that must not be angry with me dear  the worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter no one to work for  and yet obliged to be always on the lookout forchances  one must live  and so one becomes selfish  when you told me ofthe happy turn your fortunes have taken  you will hardly believe it  iwas delighted not so much on your account as on my own
nora ,nora  how do you mean   oh  i understand  you mean that perhaps torvaldcould get you something to do
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  that was what i was thinking of
nora ,nora  he must  christine  just leave it to me  i will broach the subjectvery cleverly  i will think of something that will please him very much it will make me so happy to be of some use to you
mrslinde ,mrslinde  how kind you are  nora  to be so anxious to help me  it isdoubly kind in you  for you know so little of the burdens and troublesof life
nora ,nora  i    i know so little of them
mrs ,mrs  linde   my dear  small household cares and that sort ofthing   you are a child  nora
nora ,nora   you ought not to be sosuperior
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no
nora ,nora  you are just like the others  they all think that i am incapableof anything really serious
mrslinde ,mrslinde  come  come
nora ,nora   that i have gone through nothing in this world of cares
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but  my dear nora  you have just told me all your troubles
nora ,nora  pooh   those were trifles   i have not toldyou the important thing
mrslinde ,mrslinde  the important thing  what do you mean
nora ,nora  you look down upon me altogether  christine  but you ought not to you are proud  aren t you  of having worked so hard and so long for yourmother
mrslinde ,mrslinde  indeed  i don t look down on anyone  but it is true that iam both proud and glad to think that i was privileged to make the end ofmy mother s life almost free from care
nora ,nora  and you are proud to think of what you have done for yourbrothers
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i think i have the right to be
nora ,nora  i think so  too  but now  listen to this  i too have something tobe proud and glad of
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i have no doubt you have  but what do you refer to
nora ,nora  speak low  suppose torvald were to hear  he mustn t on anyaccount  no one in the world must know  christine  except you
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but what is it
nora ,nora  come here   now i willshow you that i too have something to be proud and glad of  it was i whosaved torvald s life
mrslinde ,mrslinde   saved   how
nora ,nora  i told you about our trip to italy  torvald would never haverecovered if he had not gone there
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  but your father gave you the necessary funds
nora ,nora   yes  that is what torvald and all the others think but
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but
nora ,nora  papa didn t give us a shilling  it was i who procured the money
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you  all that large sum
nora ,nora  two hundred and fifty pounds  what do you think of that
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but  nora  how could you possibly do it  did you win a prizein the lottery
nora ,nora   in the lottery  there would have been no creditin that
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but where did you get it from  then  nora   hm  hm  aha
mrslinde ,mrslinde  because you couldn t have borrowed it
nora ,nora  couldn t i  why not
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  a wife cannot borrow without her husband s consent
nora ,nora   oh  if it is a wife who has any head forbusiness  a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i don t understand it at all  nora
nora ,nora  there is no need you should  i never said i had borrowed themoney  i may have got it some other way  perhaps i got it from some other admirer  when anyone is as attractiveas i am
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you are a mad creature
nora ,nora  now  you know you re full of curiosity  christine
mrslinde ,mrslinde  listen to me  nora dear  haven t you been a little bitimprudent
nora ,nora   is it imprudent to save your husband s life
mrslinde ,mrslinde  it seems to me imprudent  without his knowledge  to
nora ,nora  but it was absolutely necessary that he should not know  mygoodness  can t you understand that  it was necessary he should have noidea what a dangerous condition he was in  it was to me that the doctorscame and said that his life was in danger  and that the only thing tosave him was to live in the south  do you suppose i didn t try  first ofall  to get what i wanted as if it were for myself  i told him how muchi should love to travel abroad like other young wives  i tried tears andentreaties with him  i told him that he ought to remember the conditioni was in  and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me  i evenhinted that he might raise a loan  that nearly made him angry christine  he said i was thoughtless  and that it was his duty as myhusband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices  as i believe hecalled them  very well  i thought  you must be saved  and that was how icame to devise a way out of the difficulty
mrslinde ,mrslinde  and did your husband never get to know from your father thatthe money had not come from him
nora ,nora  no  never  papa died just at that time  i had meant to let himinto the secret and beg him never to reveal it  but he was so illthen  alas  there never was any need to tell him
mrslinde ,mrslinde  and since then have you never told your secret to yourhusband
nora ,nora  good heavens  no  how could you think so  a man who has suchstrong opinions about these things  and besides  how painful andhumiliating it would be for torvald  with his manly independence  toknow that he owed me anything  it would upset our mutual relationsaltogether  our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now
mrslinde ,mrslinde  do you mean never to tell him about it
nora ,nora   yes  someday  perhaps  aftermany years  when i am no longer as nice looking as i am now  don t laughat me  i mean  of course  when torvald is no longer as devoted to me ashe is now  when my dancing and dressing up and reciting have palled onhim  then it may be a good thing to have something in reserve   what nonsense  that time will never come  now  what do you thinkof my great secret  christine  do you still think i am of no use  i cantell you  too  that this affair has caused me a lot of worry  it hasbeen by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually  i maytell you that there is something that is called  in business  quarterlyinterest  and another thing called payment in installments  and it isalways so dreadfully difficult to manage them  i have had to save alittle here and there  where i could  you understand  i have not beenable to put aside much from my housekeeping money  for torvald must havea good table  i couldn t let my children be shabbily dressed  i havefelt obliged to use up all he gave me for them  the sweet littledarlings
mrslinde ,mrslinde  so it has all had to come out of your own necessaries oflife  poor nora
nora ,nora  of course  besides  i was the one responsible for it  whenevertorvald has given me money for new dresses and such things  i havenever spent more than half of it  i have always bought the simplestand cheapest things  thank heaven  any clothes look well on me  andso torvald has never noticed it  but it was often very hard on me christine  because it is delightful to be really well dressed  isn t it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  quite so
nora ,nora  well  then i have found other ways of earning money  last winteri was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do  so i locked myself upand sat writing every evening until quite late at night  many a time iwas desperately tired  but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure tosit there working and earning money  it was like being a man
mrslinde ,mrslinde  how much have you been able to pay off in that way
nora ,nora  i can t tell you exactly  you see  it is very difficult to keep anaccount of a business matter of that kind  i only know that i have paidevery penny that i could scrape together  many a time i was at my wits end   then i used to sit here and imagine that a rich oldgentleman had fallen in love with me
mrslinde ,mrslinde  what  who was it
nora ,nora  be quiet   that he had died  and that when his will was openedit contained  written in big letters  the instruction   the lovely mrs nora helmer is to have all i possess paid over to her at once in cash
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but  my dear nora  who could the man be
nora ,nora  good gracious  can t you understand  there was no old gentleman atall  it was only something that i used to sit here and imagine  when icouldn t think of any way of procuring money  but it s all the same now the tiresome old person can stay where he is  as far as i am concerned i don t care about him or his will either  for i am free from care now  my goodness  it s delightful to think of  christine  freefrom care  to be able to be free from care  quite free from care  to beable to play and romp with the children  to be able to keep the housebeautifully and have everything just as torvald likes it  and  think ofit  soon the spring will come and the big blue sky  perhaps we shall beable to take a little trip  perhaps i shall see the sea again  oh  it sa wonderful thing to be alive and be happy
mrs ,mrs  linde   there is the bell  perhaps i had better go
nora ,nora  no  don t go  no one will come in here  it is sure to be fortorvald
servant ,servant   excuse me  ma am  there is a gentleman tosee the master  and as the doctor is with him
nora ,nora  who is it
krogstad ,krogstad   it is i  mrs  helmer
nora ,nora  you  what is it  what do you want to see my husband about
krogstad ,krogstad  bank business  in a way  i have a small post in the bank  andi hear your husband is to be our chief now
nora ,nora  then it is
krogstad ,krogstad  nothing but dry business matters  mrs  helmer  absolutelynothing else
nora ,nora  be so good as to go into the study  then
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nora  who was that man
nora ,nora  a lawyer  of the name of krogstad
mrslinde ,mrslinde  then it really was he
nora ,nora  do you know the man
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i used to  many years ago  at one time he was a solicitor sclerk in our town
nora ,nora  yes  he was
mrslinde ,mrslinde  he is greatly altered
nora ,nora  he made a very unhappy marriage
mrslinde ,mrslinde  he is a widower now  isn t he
nora ,nora  with several children  there now  it is burning up
mrslinde ,mrslinde  they say he carries on various kinds of business
nora ,nora  really  perhaps he does  i don t know anything about it  but don tlet us think of business  it is so tiresome
doctor ,doctor rank   no  my dear fellow  i won t disturb you  i would rathergo in to your wife for a little while   i beg your pardon  i am afraid i am disturbing you too
nora ,nora  no  not at all    doctor rank  mrs  linde
rank ,rank  i have often heard mrs  linde s name mentioned here  i think ipassed you on the stairs when i arrived  mrs  linde
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  i go up very slowly  i can t manage stairs well
rank ,rank  ah  some slight internal weakness
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  the fact is i have been overworking myself
rank ,rank  nothing more than that  then i suppose you have come to town toamuse yourself with our entertainments
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i have come to look for work
rank ,rank  is that a good cure for overwork
mrslinde ,mrslinde  one must live  doctor rank
rank ,rank  yes  the general opinion seems to be that it is necessary
nora ,nora  look here  doctor rank  you know you want to live
rank ,rank  certainly  however wretched i may feel  i want to prolong theagony as long as possible  all my patients are like that  and so arethose who are morally diseased  one of them  and a bad case too  is atthis very moment with helmer
mrs ,mrs  linde   ah
nora ,nora  whom do you mean
rank ,rank  a lawyer of the name of krogstad  a fellow you don t know at all he suffers from a diseased moral character  mrs  helmer  but even hebegan talking of its being highly important that he should live
nora ,nora  did he  what did he want to speak to torvald about
rank ,rank  i have no idea  i only heard that it was something about the bank
nora ,nora  i didn t know this  what s his name  krogstad had anything to dowith the bank
rank ,rank  yes  he has some sort of appointment there   idon t know whether you find also in your part of the world that thereare certain people who go zealously snuffing about to smell out moralcorruption  and  as soon as they have found some  put the personconcerned into some lucrative position where they can keep their eye onhim  healthy natures are left out in the cold
mrslinde ,mrslinde  still i think the sick are those who most need taking careof
rank ,rank   yes  there you are  that is thesentiment that is turning society into a sick house
rank ,rank  why do you laugh at that  have you any notion what society reallyis
nora ,nora  what do i care about tiresome society  i am laughing at somethingquite different  something extremely amusing  tell me  doctor rank  areall the people who are employed in the bank dependent on torvald now
rank ,rank  is that what you find so extremely amusing
nora ,nora   that s my affair  it s perfectly glorious to think that we have  that torvald has so muchpower over so many people   doctorrank  what do you say to a macaroon
rank ,rank  what  macaroons  i thought they were forbidden here
nora ,nora  yes  but these are some christine gave me
mrslinde ,mrslinde  what  i
nora ,nora  oh  well  don t be alarmed  you couldn t know that torvald hadforbidden them  i must tell you that he is afraid they will spoil myteeth  but  bah   once in a way  that s so  isn t it  doctor rank  byyour leave   you must have one too christine  and i shall have one  just a little one  or at most two  i am tremendously happy  there is just one thing in theworld now that i should dearly love to do
rank ,rank  well  what is that

krogstad ,krogstad  yes  i do
nora ,nora  today  it is not the first of the month yet
krogstad ,krogstad  no  it is christmas eve  and it will depend on yourself whatsort of a christmas you will spend
nora ,nora  what do you mean  today it is absolutely impossible for me
krogstad ,krogstad  we won t talk about that until later on  this is somethingdifferent  i presume you can give me a moment
nora ,nora  yes  yes  i can  although
krogstad ,krogstad  good  i was in olsen s restaurant and saw your husband goingdown the street
nora ,nora  yes
krogstad ,krogstad  with a lady
nora ,nora  what then
krogstad ,krogstad  may i make so bold as to ask if it was a mrs  linde
nora ,nora  it was
krogstad ,krogstad  just arrived in town
nora ,nora  yes  today
krogstad ,krogstad  she is a great friend of yours  isn t she
nora ,nora  she is  but i don t see
krogstad ,krogstad  i knew her too  once upon a time
nora ,nora  i am aware of that
krogstad ,krogstad  are you  so you know all about it  i thought as much  then ican ask you  without beating about the bush  is mrs  linde to have anappointment in the bank
nora ,nora  what right have you to question me  mr  krogstad   you  one ofmy husband s subordinates  but since you ask  you shall know  yes  mrs linde is to have an appointment  and it was i who pleaded her cause  mr krogstad  let me tell you that
krogstad ,krogstad  i was right in what i thought  then
nora ,nora   sometimes one has a tiny littlebit of influence  i should hope  because one is a woman  it does notnecessarily follow that    when anyone is in a subordinate position mr  krogstad  they should really be careful to avoid offending anyonewho  who
krogstad ,krogstad  who has influence
nora ,nora  exactly
krogstad ,krogstad   mrs  helmer  you will be so good as to useyour influence on my behalf
nora ,nora  what  what do you mean
krogstad ,krogstad  you will be so kind as to see that i am allowed to keep mysubordinate position in the bank
nora ,nora  what do you mean by that  who proposes to take your post away fromyou
krogstad ,krogstad  oh  there is no necessity to keep up the pretence ofignorance  i can quite understand that your friend is not very anxiousto expose herself to the chance of rubbing shoulders with me  and iquite understand  too  whom i have to thank for being turned off
nora ,nora  but i assure you
krogstad ,krogstad  very likely  but  to come to the point  the time has come wheni should advise you to use your influence to prevent that
nora ,nora  but  mr  krogstad  i have no influence
krogstad ,krogstad  haven t you  i thought you said yourself just now
nora ,nora  naturally i did not mean you to put that construction on it  i what should make you think i have any influence of that kind with myhusband
krogstad ,krogstad  oh  i have known your husband from our student days  i don tsuppose he is any more unassailable than other husbands
nora ,nora  if you speak slightingly of my husband  i shall turn you out ofthe house
krogstad ,krogstad  you are bold  mrs  helmer
nora ,nora  i am not afraid of you any longer  as soon as the new year comes i shall in a very short time be free of the whole thing
krogstad ,krogstad   listen to me  mrs  helmer  if necessary i am prepared to fight for my small post in the bank as if i werefighting for my life
nora ,nora  so it seems
krogstad ,krogstad  it is not only for the sake of the money  indeed  that weighsleast with me in the matter  there is another reason  well  i may aswell tell you  my position is this  i daresay you know  like everybodyelse  that once  many years ago  i was guilty of an indiscretion
nora ,nora  i think i have heard something of the kind
krogstad ,krogstad  the matter never came into court  but every way seemed to beclosed to me after that  so i took to the business that you know of  ihad to do something  and  honestly  i don t think i ve been one of theworst  but now i must cut myself free from all that  my sons are growingup  for their sake i must try and win back as much respect as i can inthe town  this post in the bank was like the first step up for me  andnow your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud
nora ,nora  but you must believe me  mr  krogstad  it is not in my power tohelp you at all
krogstad ,krogstad  then it is because you haven t the will  but i have means tocompel you
nora ,nora  you don t mean that you will tell my husband that i owe you money
krogstad ,krogstad  hm   suppose i were to tell him
nora ,nora  it would be perfectly infamous of you   to think of hislearning my secret  which has been my joy and pride  in such an ugly clumsy way  that he should learn it from you  and it would put me in ahorribly disagreeable position
krogstad ,krogstad  only disagreeable
nora ,nora   well  do it  then   and it will be the worse foryou  my husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are  and youcertainly won t keep your post then
krogstad ,krogstad  i asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home thatyou were afraid of
nora ,nora  if my husband does get to know of it  of course he will at oncepay you what is still owing  and we shall have nothing more to do withyou
krogstad ,krogstad   listen to me  mrs  helmer  either youhave a very bad memory or you know very little of business  i shall beobliged to remind you of a few details
nora ,nora  what do you mean
krogstad ,krogstad  when your husband was ill  you came to me to borrow twohundred and fifty pounds
nora ,nora  i didn t know anyone else to go to
krogstad ,krogstad  i promised to get you that amount
nora ,nora  yes  and you did so
krogstad ,krogstad  i promised to get you that amount  on certain conditions your mind was so taken up with your husband s illness  and you were soanxious to get the money for your journey  that you seem to have paidno attention to the conditions of our bargain  therefore it will not beamiss if i remind you of them  now  i promised to get the money on thesecurity of a bond which i drew up
nora ,nora  yes  and which i signed
krogstad ,krogstad  good  but below your signature there were a few linesconstituting your father a surety for the money  those lines your fathershould have signed
nora ,nora  should  he did sign them
krogstad ,krogstad  i had left the date blank  that is to say  your father shouldhimself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper  do youremember that
nora ,nora  yes  i think i remember
krogstad ,krogstad  then i gave you the bond to send by post to your father  isthat not so
nora ,nora  yes
krogstad ,krogstad  and you naturally did so at once  because five or six daysafterwards you brought me the bond with your father s signature  andthen i gave you the money
nora ,nora  well  haven t i been paying it off regularly
krogstad ,krogstad  fairly so  yes  but  to come back to the matter in hand  thatmust have been a very trying time for you  mrs  helmer
nora ,nora  it was  indeed
krogstad ,krogstad  your father was very ill  wasn t he
nora ,nora  he was very near his end
krogstad ,krogstad  and died soon afterwards
nora ,nora  yes
krogstad ,krogstad  tell me  mrs  helmer  can you by any chance remember what dayyour father died   on what day of the month  i mean
nora ,nora  papa died on the 29th of september
krogstad ,krogstad  that is correct  i have ascertained it for myself  and  asthat is so  there is a discrepancy which i cannot account for
nora ,nora  what discrepancy  i don t know
krogstad ,krogstad  the discrepancy consists  mrs  helmer  in the fact that yourfather signed this bond three days after his death
nora ,nora  what do you mean  i don t understand
krogstad ,krogstad  your father died on the 29th of september  but  look here your father has dated his signature the 2nd of october  it is adiscrepancy  isn t it   can you explain it to me   it is a remarkable thing  too  that the words  2ndof october   as well as the year  are not written in your father shandwriting but in one that i think i know  well  of course it can beexplained  your father may have forgotten to date his signature  andsomeone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death there is no harm in that  it all depends on the signature of the name and that is genuine  i suppose  mrs  helmer  it was your father himselfwho signed his name here
nora ,nora   no  it was not  it was i that wrote papa s name
krogstad ,krogstad  are you aware that is a dangerous confession
nora ,nora  in what way  you shall have your money soon
krogstad ,krogstad  let me ask you a question  why did you not send the paper toyour father
nora ,nora  it was impossible  papa was so ill  if i had asked him for hissignature  i should have had to tell him what the money was to beused for  and when he was so ill himself i couldn t tell him that myhusband s life was in danger  it was impossible
krogstad ,krogstad  it would have been better for you if you had given up yourtrip abroad
nora ,nora  no  that was impossible  that trip was to save my husband s life i couldn t give that up
krogstad ,krogstad  but did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraudon me
nora ,nora  i couldn t take that into account  i didn t trouble myself aboutyou at all  i couldn t bear you  because you put so many heartlessdifficulties in my way  although you knew what a dangerous condition myhusband was in
krogstad ,krogstad  mrs  helmer  you evidently do not realise clearly what it isthat you have been guilty of  but i can assure you that my one falsestep  which lost me all my reputation  was nothing more or nothing worsethan what you have done
nora ,nora  you  do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run arisk to save your wife s life
krogstad ,krogstad  the law cares nothing about motives
nora ,nora  then it must be a very foolish law
krogstad ,krogstad  foolish or not  it is the law by which you will be judged  ifi produce this paper in court
nora ,nora  i don t believe it  is a daughter not to be allowed to spare herdying father anxiety and care  is a wife not to be allowed to save herhusband s life  i don t know much about law  but i am certain that theremust be laws permitting such things as that  have you no knowledge ofsuch laws  you who are a lawyer  you must be a very poor lawyer  mr krogstad
krogstad ,krogstad  maybe  but matters of business  such business as you and ihave had together  do you think i don t understand that  very well  doas you please  but let me tell you this  if i lose my position a secondtime  you shall lose yours with me
nora ,nora  nonsense  trying to frighten me like that   i am not so silly as hethinks  and yet    no  it s impossible  i did it for love s sake
the ,the children   mother  the stranger man hasgone out through the gate
nora ,nora  yes  dears  i know  but  don t tell anyone about the stranger man do you hear  not even papa
children ,children  no  mother  but will you come and play again
nora ,nora  no  no   not now
children ,children  but  mother  you promised us
nora ,nora  yes  but i can t now  run away in  i have such a lot to do  runaway in  my sweet little darlings   no
helen ,helen  bring the tree in   no  no  it is quite impossible
maid ,maid   where shall i put it  ma am
nora ,nora  here  in the middle of the floor
maid ,maid  shall i get you anything else
nora ,nora  no  thank you  i have all i want   exit maid
nora ,nora   a candle here and flowers here  thehorrible man  it s all nonsense  there s nothing wrong  the treeshall be splendid  i will do everything i can think of to please you torvald   i will sing for you  dance for you   oh  are you back already
helmer ,helmer  yes  has anyone been here
nora ,nora  here  no
helmer ,helmer  that is strange  i saw krogstad going out of the gate
nora ,nora  did you  oh yes  i forgot  krogstad was here for a moment
helmer ,helmer  nora  i can see from your manner that he has been here beggingyou to say a good word for him
nora ,nora  yes
helmer ,helmer  and you were to appear to do it of your own accord  you were toconceal from me the fact of his having been here  didn t he beg that ofyou too
nora ,nora  yes  torvald  but
helmer ,helmer  nora  nora  and you would be a party to that sort of thing  tohave any talk with a man like that  and give him any sort of promise and to tell me a lie into the bargain
nora ,nora  a lie
helmer ,helmer  didn t you tell me no one had been here   my little songbird must never do that again  a songbird must havea clean beak to chirp with  no false notes   that is so  isn t it  yes  i am sure it is   wewill say no more about it   how warm and snugit is here
nora ,nora  torvald
helmer ,helmer  yes
nora ,nora  i am looking forward tremendously to the fancy dress ball at thestenborgs  the day after tomorrow
helmer ,helmer  and i am tremendously curious to see what you are going tosurprise me with
nora ,nora  it was very silly of me to want to do that
helmer ,helmer  what do you mean
nora ,nora  i can t hit upon anything that will do  everything i think ofseems so silly and insignificant
helmer ,helmer  does my little nora acknowledge that at last
nora ,nora   areyou very busy  torvald
helmer ,helmer  well
nora ,nora  what are all those papers
helmer ,helmer  bank business
nora ,nora  already
helmer ,helmer  i have got authority from the retiring manager to undertake thenecessary changes in the staff and in the rearrangement of the work  andi must make use of the christmas week for that  so as to have everythingin order for the new year
nora ,nora  then that was why this poor krogstad
helmer ,helmer  hm
nora ,nora   if youhadn t been so busy i should have asked you a tremendously big favour torvald
helmer ,helmer  what is that  tell me
nora ,nora  there is no one has such good taste as you  and i do so want tolook nice at the fancy dress ball  torvald  couldn t you take me in handand decide what i shall go as  and what sort of a dress i shall wear
helmer ,helmer  aha  so my obstinate little woman is obliged to get someone tocome to her rescue
nora ,nora  yes  torvald  i can t get along a bit without your help
helmer ,helmer  very well  i will think it over  we shall manage to hit uponsomething
nora ,nora  that is nice of you  how pretty the red flowers look    but  tell me  was it really somethingvery bad that this krogstad was guilty of
helmer ,helmer  he forged someone s name  have you any idea what that means
nora ,nora  isn t it possible that he was driven to do it by necessity
helmer ,helmer  yes  or  as in so many cases  by imprudence  i am not soheartless as to condemn a man altogether because of a single false stepof that kind
nora ,nora  no  you wouldn t  would you  torvald
helmer ,helmer  many a man has been able to retrieve his character  if he hasopenly confessed his fault and taken his punishment
nora ,nora  punishment
helmer ,helmer  but krogstad did nothing of that sort  he got himself out of itby a cunning trick  and that is why he has gone under altogether
nora ,nora  but do you think it would
helmer ,helmer  just think how a guilty man like that has to lie and play thehypocrite with every one  how he has to wear a mask in the presence ofthose near and dear to him  even before his own wife and children  andabout the children  that is the most terrible part of it all  nora
nora ,nora  how
helmer ,helmer  because such an atmosphere of lies infects and poisons the wholelife of a home  each breath the children take in such a house is full ofthe germs of evil
nora ,nora   are you sure of that
helmer ,helmer  my dear  i have often seen it in the course of my life as alawyer  almost everyone who has gone to the bad early in life has had adeceitful mother
nora ,nora  why do you only say  mother
helmer ,helmer  it seems most commonly to be the mother s influence  thoughnaturally a bad father s would have the same result  every lawyeris familiar with the fact  this krogstad  now  has been persistentlypoisoning his own children with lies and dissimulation  that is why isay he has lost all moral character   thatis why my sweet little nora must promise me not to plead his cause  giveme your hand on it  come  come  what is this  give me your hand  therenow  that s settled  i assure you it would be quite impossible for me towork with him  i literally feel physically ill when i am in the companyof such people
nora ,nora   how hot it is in here  and i have such a lot to do
helmer ,helmer   yes  and i musttry and read through some of these before dinner  and i must think aboutyour costume  too  and it is just possible i may have something readyin gold paper to hang up on the tree   myprecious little singing bird
nora ,nora   no  no  it isn t true  it s impossible it must be impossible
nurse ,nurse  the little ones are begging so hard to be allowed to come in tomamma
nora ,nora  no  no  no  don t let them come in to me  you stay with them anne
nurse ,nurse  very well  ma am
nora ,nora   deprave my little children  poison my home   it s not true  it can t possiblybe true
act ,act ii
nora ,nora   someone is coming now   no  it is no one  of course  no one will come today  christmasday  nor tomorrow either  but  perhaps   no  nothing in the letterbox  it is quite empty  what rubbish  of course he can t be in earnest about it  such a thingcouldn t happen  it is impossible  i have three little children
nurse ,nurse  at last i have found the box with the fancy dress
nora ,nora  thanks  put it on the table
nurse ,nurse   but it is very much in want of mending
nora ,nora  i should like to tear it into a hundred thousand pieces
nurse ,nurse  what an idea  it can easily be put in order  just a littlepatience
nora ,nora  yes  i will go and get mrs  linde to come and help me with it
nurse ,nurse  what  out again  in this horrible weather  you will catch cold ma am  and make yourself ill
nora ,nora  well  worse than that might happen  how are the children
nurse ,nurse  the poor little souls are playing with their christmas presents but
nora ,nora  do they ask much for me
nurse ,nurse  you see  they are so accustomed to have their mamma with them
nora ,nora  yes  but  nurse  i shall not be able to be so much with them nowas i was before
nurse ,nurse  oh well  young children easily get accustomed to anything
nora ,nora  do you think so  do you think they would forget their mother ifshe went away altogether
nurse ,nurse  good heavens   went away altogether
nora ,nora  nurse  i want you to tell me something i have often wonderedabout  how could you have the heart to put your own child out amongstrangers
nurse ,nurse  i was obliged to  if i wanted to be little nora s nurse
nora ,nora  yes  but how could you be willing to do it
nurse ,nurse  what  when i was going to get such a good place by it  a poorgirl who has got into trouble should be glad to  besides  that wickedman didn t do a single thing for me
nora ,nora  but i suppose your daughter has quite forgotten you
nurse ,nurse  no  indeed she hasn t  she wrote to me when she was confirmed and when she was married
nora ,nora   dear old anne  you were a goodmother to me when i was little
nurse ,nurse  little nora  poor dear  had no other mother but me  nora  and ifmy little ones had no other mother  i am sure you would  what nonsensei am talking   go in to them  now i must    you will seetomorrow how charming i shall look
nurse ,nurse  i am sure there will be no one at the ball so charming as you ma am
nora ,nora   ifonly i dared go out  if only no one would come  if only i could be surenothing would happen here in the meantime  stuff and nonsense  no onewill come  only i mustn t think about it  i will brush my muff  whatlovely  lovely gloves  out of my thoughts  out of my thoughts  one two  three  four  five  six    ah  there is someone coming
nora ,nora  oh  it s you  christine  there is no one else out there  is there how good of you to come
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i heard you were up asking for me
nora ,nora  yes  i was passing by  as a matter of fact  it is somethingyou could help me with  let us sit down here on the sofa  look here tomorrow evening there is to be a fancy dress ball at the stenborgs  who live above us  and torvald wants me to go as a neapolitanfisher girl  and dance the tarantella that i learned at capri
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i see  you are going to keep up the character
nora ,nora  yes  torvald wants me to  look  here is the dress  torvald had itmade for me there  but now it is all so torn  and i haven t any idea
mrslinde ,mrslinde  we will easily put that right  it is only some of thetrimming come unsewn here and there  needle and thread  now then  that sall we want
nora ,nora  it is nice of you
mrs ,mrs  linde   so you are going to be dressed up tomorrow nora i will tell you what  i shall come in for a moment and see you inyour fine feathers  but i have completely forgotten to thank you for adelightful evening yesterday
nora ,nora   well  i don t think yesterday wasas pleasant as usual  you ought to have come to town a little earlier christine  certainly torvald does understand how to make a house daintyand attractive
mrslinde ,mrslinde  and so do you  it seems to me  you are not your father sdaughter for nothing  but tell me  is doctor rank always as depressed ashe was yesterday
nora ,nora  no  yesterday it was very noticeable  i must tell you that hesuffers from a very dangerous disease  he has consumption of the spine poor creature  his father was a horrible man who committed all sortsof excesses  and that is why his son was sickly from childhood  do youunderstand
mrs ,mrs  linde   but  my dearest nora  how do you knowanything about such things
nora ,nora   pooh  when you have three children  you get visitsnow and then from  from married women  who know something of medicalmatters  and they talk about one thing and another
mrs ,mrs  linde   does doctor rank come hereeveryday
nora ,nora  everyday regularly  he is torvald s most intimate friend  and agreat friend of mine too  he is just like one of the family
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but tell me this  is he perfectly sincere  i mean  isn t hethe kind of man that is very anxious to make himself agreeable
nora ,nora  not in the least  what makes you think that
mrslinde ,mrslinde  when you introduced him to me yesterday  he declared he hadoften heard my name mentioned in this house  but afterwards i noticedthat your husband hadn t the slightest idea who i was  so how coulddoctor rank
nora ,nora  that is quite right  christine  torvald is so absurdly fond of methat he wants me absolutely to himself  as he says  at first he usedto seem almost jealous if i mentioned any of the dear folk at home  sonaturally i gave up doing so  but i often talk about such things withdoctor rank  because he likes hearing about them
mrslinde ,mrslinde  listen to me  nora  you are still very like a child in manythings  and i am older than you in many ways and have a little moreexperience  let me tell you this  you ought to make an end of it withdoctor rank
nora ,nora  what ought i to make an end of
mrslinde ,mrslinde  of two things  i think  yesterday you talked some nonsenseabout a rich admirer who was to leave you money
nora ,nora  an admirer who doesn t exist  unfortunately  but what then
mrslinde ,mrslinde  is doctor rank a man of means
nora ,nora  yes  he is
mrslinde ,mrslinde  and has no one to provide for
nora ,nora  no  no one  but
mrslinde ,mrslinde  and comes here everyday
nora ,nora  yes  i told you so
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but how can this well bred man be so tactless
nora ,nora  i don t understand you at all
mrslinde ,mrslinde  don t prevaricate  nora  do you suppose i don t guess wholent you the two hundred and fifty pounds
nora ,nora  are you out of your senses  how can you think of such a thing  afriend of ours  who comes here everyday  do you realise what a horriblypainful position that would be
mrslinde ,mrslinde  then it really isn t he
nora ,nora  no  certainly not  it would never have entered into my head fora moment  besides  he had no money to lend then  he came into his moneyafterwards
mrslinde ,mrslinde  well  i think that was lucky for you  my dear nora
nora ,nora  no  it would never have come into my head to ask doctor rank although i am quite sure that if i had asked him
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but of course you won t
nora ,nora  of course not  i have no reason to think it could possibly benecessary  but i am quite sure that if i told doctor rank
mrslinde ,mrslinde  behind your husband s back
nora ,nora  i must make an end of it with the other one  and that will bebehind his back too  i must make an end of it with him
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  that is what i told you yesterday  but
nora ,nora   a man can put a thing like that straightmuch easier than a woman
mrslinde ,mrslinde  one s husband  yes
nora ,nora  nonsense   when you pay off a debt you get yourbond back  don t you
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  as a matter of course
nora ,nora  and can tear it into a hundred thousand pieces  and burn itup  the nasty dirty paper
mrs ,mrs  linde  nora  you are concealing something from me
nora ,nora  do i look as if i were
mrslinde ,mrslinde  something has happened to you since yesterday morning  nora what is it
nora ,nora   christine   hush  there s torvaldcome home  do you mind going in to the children for the present  torvaldcan t bear to see dressmaking going on  let anne help you
mrs ,mrs  linde   certainly  but i amnot going away from here until we have had it out with one another
nora ,nora   i have wanted you so much  torvald dear
helmer ,helmer  was that the dressmaker
nora ,nora  no  it was christine  she is helping me to put my dress in order you will see i shall look quite smart
helmer ,helmer  wasn t that a happy thought of mine  now
nora ,nora  splendid  but don t you think it is nice of me  too  to do as youwish
helmer ,helmer  nice   because you do as your husband wishes  well  well  youlittle rogue  i am sure you did not mean it in that way  but i amnot going to disturb you  you will want to be trying on your dress  iexpect
nora ,nora  i suppose you are going to work
helmer ,helmer  yes   look at that  i have justbeen into the bank
nora ,nora  torvald
helmer ,helmer  yes
nora ,nora  if your little squirrel were to ask you for something very  veryprettily
helmer ,helmer  what then
nora ,nora  would you do it
helmer ,helmer  i should like to hear what it is  first
nora ,nora  your squirrel would run about and do all her tricks if you wouldbe nice  and do what she wants
helmer ,helmer  speak plainly
nora ,nora  your skylark would chirp about in every room  with her song risingand falling
helmer ,helmer  well  my skylark does that anyhow
nora ,nora  i would play the fairy and dance for you in the moonlight torvald
helmer ,helmer  nora  you surely don t mean that request you made to me thismorning
nora ,nora   yes  torvald  i beg you so earnestly
helmer ,helmer  have you really the courage to open up that question again
nora ,nora  yes  dear  you must do as i ask  you must let krogstad keep hispost in the bank
helmer ,helmer  my dear nora  it is his post that i have arranged mrs  lindeshall have
nora ,nora  yes  you have been awfully kind about that  but you could just aswell dismiss some other clerk instead of krogstad
helmer ,helmer  this is simply incredible obstinacy  because you chose to givehim a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him  i am expectedto
nora ,nora  that isn t the reason  torvald  it is for your own sake  thisfellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers  you have told me soyourself  he can do you an unspeakable amount of harm  i am frightenedto death of him
helmer ,helmer  ah  i understand  it is recollections of the past that scareyou
nora ,nora  what do you mean
helmer ,helmer  naturally you are thinking of your father
nora ,nora  yes  yes  of course  just recall to your mind what these maliciouscreatures wrote in the papers about papa  and how horribly theyslandered him  i believe they would have procured his dismissal if thedepartment had not sent you over to inquire into it  and if you had notbeen so kindly disposed and helpful to him
helmer ,helmer  my little nora  there is an important difference between yourfather and me  your father s reputation as a public official was notabove suspicion  mine is  and i hope it will continue to be so  as longas i hold my office
nora ,nora  you never can tell what mischief these men may contrive  we oughtto be so well off  so snug and happy here in our peaceful home  and haveno cares  you and i and the children  torvald  that is why i beg you soearnestly
helmer ,helmer  and it is just by interceding for him that you make itimpossible for me to keep him  it is already known at the bank that imean to dismiss krogstad  is it to get about now that the new managerhas changed his mind at his wife s bidding
nora ,nora  and what if it did
helmer ,helmer  of course   if only this obstinate little person can get herway  do you suppose i am going to make myself ridiculous before my wholestaff  to let people think that i am a man to be swayed by all sorts ofoutside influence  i should very soon feel the consequences of it  i cantell you  and besides  there is one thing that makes it quite impossiblefor me to have krogstad in the bank as long as i am manager
nora ,nora  whatever is that
helmer ,helmer  his moral failings i might perhaps have overlooked  ifnecessary
nora ,nora  yes  you could  couldn t you
helmer ,helmer  and i hear he is a good worker  too  but i knew him when wewere boys  it was one of those rash friendships that so often prove anincubus in afterlife  i may as well tell you plainly  we were once onvery intimate terms with one another  but this tactless fellow lays norestraint on himself when other people are present  on the contrary he thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me  andevery minute it is  i say  helmer  old fellow   and that sort of thing i assure you it is extremely painful for me  he would make my positionin the bank intolerable
nora ,nora  torvald  i don t believe you mean that
helmer ,helmer  don t you  why not
nora ,nora  because it is such a narrow minded way of looking at things
helmer ,helmer  what are you saying  narrow minded  do you think i amnarrow minded
nora ,nora  no  just the opposite  dear  and it is exactly for that reason
helmer ,helmer  it s the same thing  you say my point of view is narrow minded so i must be so too  narrow minded  very well  i must put an end tothis   helen
nora ,nora  what are you going to do
helmer ,helmer   settle it   look here take this letter and go downstairs with it at once  find a messenger andtell him to deliver it  and be quick  the address is on it  and here isthe money
maid ,maid  very well  sir
helmer ,helmer   now then  little miss obstinate
nora ,nora   torvald  what was that letter
helmer ,helmer  krogstad s dismissal
nora ,nora  call her back  torvald  there is still time  oh torvald  call herback  do it for my sake  for your own sake  for the children s sake  doyou hear me  torvald  call her back  you don t know what that letter canbring upon us
helmer ,helmer  it s too late
nora ,nora  yes  it s too late
helmer ,helmer  my dear nora  i can forgive the anxiety you are in  althoughreally it is an insult to me  it is  indeed  isn t it an insult to thinkthat i should be afraid of a starving quill driver s vengeance  but iforgive you nevertheless  because it is such eloquent witness to yourgreat love for me   and that is as it should be my own darling nora  come what will  you may be sure i shall have bothcourage and strength if they be needed  you will see i am man enough totake everything upon myself
nora ,nora   what do you mean by that
helmer ,helmer  everything  i say
nora ,nora   you will never have to do that
helmer ,helmer  that s right  well  we will share it  nora  as man and wifeshould  that is how it shall be   are you content now there  there   not these frightened dove s eyes  the whole thing is onlythe wildest fancy   now  you must go and play through the tarantella andpractise with your tambourine  i shall go into the inner office and shutthe door  and i shall hear nothing  you can make as much noise as youplease   and when rank comes  tell him where hewill find me
nora ,nora   he was capable of doing it  he will do it  he will do it inspite of everything   no  not that  never  never  anything rather thanthat  oh  for some help  some way out of it  doctor rank  anything rather than that  anything  whatever it is
nora ,nora  good day  doctor rank  i knew your ring  but you mustn t go in totorvald now  i think he is busy with something
rank ,rank  and you
nora ,nora   oh  you know verywell i always have time for you
rank ,rank  thank you  i shall make use of as much of it as i can
nora ,nora  what do you mean by that  as much of it as you can
rank ,rank  well  does that alarm you
nora ,nora  it was such a strange way of putting it  is anything likely tohappen
rank ,rank  nothing but what i have long been prepared for  but i certainlydidn t expect it to happen so soon
nora ,nora   what have you found out  doctor rank you must tell me
rank ,rank   it is all up with me  and it can t behelped
nora ,nora   is it about yourself
rank ,rank  who else  it is no use lying to one s self  i am the most wretchedof all my patients  mrs  helmer  lately i have been taking stock of myinternal economy  bankrupt  probably within a month i shall lie rottingin the churchyard
nora ,nora  what an ugly thing to say
rank ,rank  the thing itself is cursedly ugly  and the worst of it is that ishall have to face so much more that is ugly before that  i shall onlymake one more examination of myself  when i have done that  i shall knowpretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution willbegin  there is something i want to tell you  helmer s refined naturegives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly  i won thave him in my sick room
nora ,nora  oh  but  doctor rank
rank ,rank  i won t have him there  not on any account  i bar my door to him as soon as i am quite certain that the worst has come  i shall sendyou my card with a black cross on it  and then you will know that theloathsome end has begun
nora ,nora  you are quite absurd today  and i wanted you so much to be in areally good humour
rank ,rank  with death stalking beside me   to have to pay this penalty foranother man s sin  is there any justice in that  and in every singlefamily  in one way or another  some such inexorable retribution is beingexacted
nora ,nora   rubbish  do talk of somethingcheerful
rank ,rank  oh  it s a mere laughing matter  the whole thing  my poor innocentspine has to suffer for my father s youthful amusements
nora ,nora   i suppose you mean that he wastoo partial to asparagus and pate de foie gras  don t you
rank ,rank  yes  and to truffles
nora ,nora  truffles  yes  and oysters too  i suppose
rank ,rank  oysters  of course  that goes without saying
nora ,nora  and heaps of port and champagne  it is sad that all these nicethings should take their revenge on our bones
rank ,rank  especially that they should revenge themselves on the unluckybones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them
nora ,nora  yes  that s the saddest part of it all
rank ,rank   hm
nora ,nora   why did you smile
rank ,rank  no  it was you that laughed
nora ,nora  no  it was you that smiled  doctor rank
rank ,rank   you are a greater rascal than i thought
nora ,nora  i am in a silly mood today
rank ,rank  so it seems
nora ,nora   dear  dear doctor rank  deathmustn t take you away from torvald and me
rank ,rank  it is a loss you would easily recover from  those who are gone aresoon forgotten
nora ,nora   do you believe that
rank ,rank  people form new ties  and then
nora ,nora  who will form new ties
rank ,rank  both you and helmer  when i am gone  you yourself are already onthe high road to it  i think  what did that mrs  linde want here lastnight
nora ,nora  oho   you don t mean to say you are jealous of poor christine
rank ,rank  yes  i am  she will be my successor in this house  when i am donefor  this woman will
nora ,nora  hush  don t speak so loud  she is in that room
rank ,rank  today again  there  you see
nora ,nora  she has only come to sew my dress for me  bless my soul  howunreasonable you are   be nice now  doctor rank and tomorrow you will see how beautifully i shall dance  and you canimagine i am doing it all for you  and for torvald too  of course  doctor rank  come and sit downhere  and i will show you something
rank ,rank   what is it
nora ,nora  just look at those
rank ,rank  silk stockings
nora ,nora  flesh coloured  aren t they lovely  it is so dark here now  buttomorrow    no  no  no  you must only look at the feet  oh well  you mayhave leave to look at the legs too
rank ,rank  hm   nora  why are you looking so critical  don t you think theywill fit me
rank ,rank  i have no means of forming an opinion about that
nora ,nora   for shame   that s to punish you
rank ,rank  and what other nice things am i to be allowed to see
nora ,nora  not a single thing more  for being so naughty
rank ,rank   when i am sitting here  talking to you asintimately as this  i cannot imagine for a moment what would have becomeof me if i had never come into this house
nora ,nora   i believe you do feel thoroughly at home with us
rank ,rank   and to beobliged to leave it all
nora ,nora  nonsense  you are not going to leave it
rank ,rank   and not be able to leave behind one the slightesttoken of one s gratitude  scarcely even a fleeting regret  nothing butan empty place which the first comer can fill as well as any other
nora ,nora  and if i asked you now for a    no
rank ,rank  for what
nora ,nora  for a big proof of your friendship
rank ,rank  yes  yes
nora ,nora  i mean a tremendously big favour
rank ,rank  would you really make me so happy for once
nora ,nora  ah  but you don t know what it is yet
rank ,rank  no  but tell me
nora ,nora  i really can t  doctor rank  it is something out of all reason  itmeans advice  and help  and a favour
rank ,rank  the bigger a thing it is the better  i can t conceive what it isyou mean  do tell me  haven t i your confidence
nora ,nora  more than anyone else  i know you are my truest and best friend and so i will tell you what it is  well  doctor rank  it is somethingyou must help me to prevent  you know how devotedly  how inexpressiblydeeply torvald loves me  he would never for a moment hesitate to givehis life for me
rank ,rank   nora  do you think he is the only one
nora ,nora   the only one
rank ,rank  the only one who would gladly give his life for your sake
nora ,nora   is that it
rank ,rank  i was determined you should know it before i went away  and therewill never be a better opportunity than this  now you know it  nora  andnow you know  too  that you can trust me as you would trust no one else
nora ,nora   let me pass
rank ,rank   nora
nora ,nora   helen  bring in the lamp   dear doctor rank  that was really horrid of you
rank ,rank  to have loved you as much as anyone else does  was that horrid
nora ,nora  no  but to go and tell me so  there was really no need
rank ,rank  what do you mean  did you know     nora  mrs  helmer  tell me  had youany idea of this
nora ,nora  oh  how do i know whether i had or whether i hadn t  i reallycan t tell you  to think you could be so clumsy  doctor rank  we weregetting on so nicely
rank ,rank  well  at all events you know now that you can command me  body andsoul  so won t you speak out
nora ,nora   after what happened
rank ,rank  i beg you to let me know what it is
nora ,nora  i can t tell you anything now
rank ,rank  yes  yes  you mustn t punish me in that way  let me havepermission to do for you whatever a man may do
nora ,nora  you can do nothing for me now  besides  i really don t need anyhelp at all  you will find that the whole thing is merely fancy on mypart  it really is so  of course it is   you are a nice sort of man  doctorrank   don t you feel ashamed of yourself  now the lamp has come
rank ,rank  not a bit  but perhaps i had better go  for ever
nora ,nora  no  indeed  you shall not  of course you must come here just asbefore  you know very well torvald can t do without you
rank ,rank  yes  but you
nora ,nora  oh  i am always tremendously pleased when you come
rank ,rank  it is just that  that put me on the wrong track  you are a riddleto me  i have often thought that you would almost as soon be in mycompany as in helmer s
nora ,nora  yes  you see there are some people one loves best  and others whomone would almost always rather have as companions
rank ,rank  yes  there is something in that
nora ,nora  when i was at home  of course i loved papa best  but i alwaysthought it tremendous fun if i could steal down into the maids  room because they never moralised at all  and talked to each other about suchentertaining things
rank ,rank  i see  it is their place i have taken
nora ,nora   oh  dear  nice doctor rank  i nevermeant that at all  but surely you can understand that being with torvaldis a little like being with papa
maid ,maid  if you please  ma am
nora ,nora   oh
rank ,rank  is there anything wrong
nora ,nora  no  no  not in the least  it is only something  it is my newdress
rank ,rank  what  your dress is lying there
nora ,nora  oh  yes  that one  but this is another  i ordered it  torvaldmustn t know about it
rank ,rank  oho  then that was the great secret
nora ,nora  of course  just go in to him  he is sitting in the inner room keep him as long as
rank ,rank  make your mind easy  i won t let him escape
nora ,nora   and he is standing waiting in the kitchen
maid ,maid  yes  he came up the back stairs
nora ,nora  but didn t you tell him no one was in
maid ,maid  yes  but it was no good
nora ,nora  he won t go away
maid ,maid  no  he says he won t until he has seen you  ma am
nora ,nora  well  let him come in  but quietly  helen  you mustn t sayanything about it to anyone  it is a surprise for my husband
maid ,maid  yes  ma am  i quite understand
nora ,nora  this dreadful thing is going to happen  it will happen in spite ofme  no  no  no  it can t happen  it shan t happen
nora ,nora   speak low  my husband is at home
krogstad ,krogstad  no matter about that
nora ,nora  what do you want of me
krogstad ,krogstad  an explanation of something
nora ,nora  make haste then  what is it
krogstad ,krogstad  you know  i suppose  that i have got my dismissal
nora ,nora  i couldn t prevent it  mr  krogstad  i fought as hard as i couldon your side  but it was no good
krogstad ,krogstad  does your husband love you so little  then  he knows what ican expose you to  and yet he ventures
nora ,nora  how can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort
krogstad ,krogstad  i didn t suppose so at all  it would not be the least like ourdear torvald helmer to show so much courage
nora ,nora  mr  krogstad  a little respect for my husband  please
krogstad ,krogstad  certainly  all the respect he deserves  but since you havekept the matter so carefully to yourself  i make bold to suppose thatyou have a little clearer idea  than you had yesterday  of what itactually is that you have done
nora ,nora  more than you could ever teach me
krogstad ,krogstad  yes  such a bad lawyer as i am
nora ,nora  what is it you want of me
krogstad ,krogstad  only to see how you were  mrs  helmer  i have been thinkingabout you all day long  a mere cashier  a quill driver  a  well  a manlike me  even he has a little of what is called feeling  you know
nora ,nora  show it  then  think of my little children
krogstad ,krogstad  have you and your husband thought of mine  but never mindabout that  i only wanted to tell you that you need not take this mattertoo seriously  in the first place there will be no accusation made on mypart
nora ,nora  no  of course not  i was sure of that
krogstad ,krogstad  the whole thing can be arranged amicably  there is no reasonwhy anyone should know anything about it  it will remain a secretbetween us three
nora ,nora  my husband must never get to know anything about it
krogstad ,krogstad  how will you be able to prevent it  am i to understand thatyou can pay the balance that is owing
nora ,nora  no  not just at present
krogstad ,krogstad  or perhaps that you have some expedient for raising the moneysoon
nora ,nora  no expedient that i mean to make use of
krogstad ,krogstad  well  in any case  it would have been of no use to you now  ifyou stood there with ever so much money in your hand  i would never partwith your bond
nora ,nora  tell me what purpose you mean to put it to
krogstad ,krogstad  i shall only preserve it  keep it in my possession  no one whois not concerned in the matter shall have the slightest hint of it  sothat if the thought of it has driven you to any desperate resolution
nora ,nora  it has
krogstad ,krogstad  if you had it in your mind to run away from your home
nora ,nora  i had
krogstad ,krogstad  or even something worse
nora ,nora  how could you know that
krogstad ,krogstad  give up the idea
nora ,nora  how did you know i had thought of that
krogstad ,krogstad  most of us think of that at first  i did  too  but i hadn tthe courage
nora ,nora   no more had i
krogstad ,krogstad   no  that s it  isn t it  you hadn t thecourage either
nora ,nora  no  i haven t  i haven t
krogstad ,krogstad  besides  it would have been a great piece of folly  once thefirst storm at home is over    i have a letter for your husband in mypocket
nora ,nora  telling him everything
krogstad ,krogstad  in as lenient a manner as i possibly could
nora ,nora   he mustn t get the letter  tear it up  i will find somemeans of getting money
krogstad ,krogstad  excuse me  mrs  helmer  but i think i told you just now
nora ,nora  i am not speaking of what i owe you  tell me what sum you areasking my husband for  and i will get the money
krogstad ,krogstad  i am not asking your husband for a penny
nora ,nora  what do you want  then
krogstad ,krogstad  i will tell you  i want to rehabilitate myself  mrs  helmer  iwant to get on  and in that your husband must help me  for the last yearand a half i have not had a hand in anything dishonourable  amid allthat time i have been struggling in most restricted circumstances  i wascontent to work my way up step by step  now i am turned out  and i amnot going to be satisfied with merely being taken into favour again i want to get on  i tell you  i want to get into the bank again  in ahigher position  your husband must make a place for me
nora ,nora  that he will never do
krogstad ,krogstad  he will  i know him  he dare not protest  and as soon as i amin there again with him  then you will see  within a year i shall be themanager s right hand  it will be nils krogstad and not torvald helmerwho manages the bank
nora ,nora  that s a thing you will never see
krogstad ,krogstad  do you mean that you will
nora ,nora  i have courage enough for it now
krogstad ,krogstad  oh  you can t frighten me  a fine  spoilt lady like you
nora ,nora  you will see  you will see
krogstad ,krogstad  under the ice  perhaps  down into the cold  coal black water and then  in the spring  to float up to the surface  all horrible andunrecognisable  with your hair fallen out
nora ,nora  you can t frighten me
krogstad ,krogstad  nor you me  people don t do such things  mrs  helmer  besides what use would it be  i should have him completely in my power all thesame
nora ,nora  afterwards  when i am no longer
krogstad ,krogstad  have you forgotten that it is i who have the keeping of yourreputation   well  now  i havewarned you  do not do anything foolish  when helmer has had my letter i shall expect a message from him  and be sure you remember that it isyour husband himself who has forced me into such ways as this again  iwill never forgive him for that  goodbye  mrs  helmer
nora ,nora  he isgoing  he is not putting the letter in the box  oh no  no  that simpossible   what is that  he is standingoutside  he is not going downstairs  is he hesitating  can he
nora ,nora  in the letter box   there itlies  torvald  torvald  there is no hope for us now
mrslinde ,mrslinde  there  i can t see anything more to mend now  would you liketo try it on
nora ,nora   christine  come here
mrs ,mrs  linde   what is the matterwith you  you look so agitated
nora ,nora  come here  do you see that letter  there  look  you can see itthrough the glass in the letter box
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  i see it
nora ,nora  that letter is from krogstad
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nora  it was krogstad who lent you the money
nora ,nora  yes  and now torvald will know all about it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  believe me  nora  that s the best thing for both of you
nora ,nora  you don t know all  i forged a name
mrslinde ,mrslinde  good heavens
nora ,nora  i only want to say this to you  christine  you must be my witness
mrslinde ,mrslinde  your witness  what do you mean  what am i to
nora ,nora  if i should go out of my mind  and it might easily happen
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nora
nora ,nora  or if anything else should happen to me  anything  for instance that might prevent my being here
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nora  nora  you are quite out of your mind
nora ,nora  and if it should happen that there were some one who wanted totake all the responsibility  all the blame  you understand
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  yes  but how can you suppose
nora ,nora  then you must be my witness  that it is not true  christine  i amnot out of my mind at all  i am in my right senses now  and i tell youno one else has known anything about it  i  and i alone  did the wholething  remember that
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i will  indeed  but i don t understand all this
nora ,nora  how should you understand it  a wonderful thing is going tohappen
mrslinde ,mrslinde  a wonderful thing
nora ,nora  yes  a wonderful thing   but it is so terrible  christine  itmustn t happen  not for all the world
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i will go at once and see krogstad
nora ,nora  don t go to him  he will do you some harm
mrslinde ,mrslinde  there was a time when he would gladly do anything for mysake

mrslinde ,mrslinde  and your husband keeps the key
nora ,nora  yes  always
mrslinde ,mrslinde  krogstad must ask for his letter back unread  he must findsome pretence

act ,act iii
mrs ,mrs  linde   not yet  and the time is nearly up if only he does not     ah  there he is   come in  there is no one here
krogstad ,krogstad   i found a note from you at home  what doesthis mean
mrslinde ,mrslinde  it is absolutely necessary that i should have a talk withyou
krogstad ,krogstad  really  and is it absolutely necessary that it should be here
mrslinde ,mrslinde  it is impossible where i live  there is no private entranceto my rooms  come in  we are quite alone  the maid is asleep  and thehelmers are at the dance upstairs
krogstad ,krogstad   are the helmers really at a dancetonight
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  why not
krogstad ,krogstad  certainly  why not
mrslinde ,mrslinde  now  nils  let us have a talk
krogstad ,krogstad  can we two have anything to talk about
mrslinde ,mrslinde  we have a great deal to talk about
krogstad ,krogstad  i shouldn t have thought so
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  you have never properly understood me
krogstad ,krogstad  was there anything else to understand except what was obviousto all the world  a heartless woman jilts a man when a more lucrativechance turns up
mrslinde ,mrslinde  do you believe i am as absolutely heartless as all that  anddo you believe that i did it with a light heart
krogstad ,krogstad  didn t you
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nils  did you really think that
krogstad ,krogstad  if it were as you say  why did you write to me as you did atthe time
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i could do nothing else  as i had to break with you  it wasmy duty also to put an end to all that you felt for me
krogstad ,krogstad   so that was it  and all this  only forthe sake of money
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you must not forget that i had a helpless mother and twolittle brothers  we couldn t wait for you  nils  your prospects seemedhopeless then
krogstad ,krogstad  that may be so  but you had no right to throw me over foranyone else s sake
mrslinde ,mrslinde  indeed i don t know  many a time did i ask myself if i hadthe right to do it
krogstad ,krogstad   when i lost you  it was as if all the solidground went from under my feet  look at me now  i am a shipwrecked manclinging to a bit of wreckage
mrslinde ,mrslinde  but help may be near
krogstad ,krogstad  it was near  but then you came and stood in my way
mrslinde ,mrslinde  unintentionally  nils  it was only today that i learned itwas your place i was going to take in the bank
krogstad ,krogstad  i believe you  if you say so  but now that you know it  areyou not going to give it up to me
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  because that would not benefit you in the least
krogstad ,krogstad  oh  benefit  benefit  i would have done it whether or no
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i have learned to act prudently  life  and hard  bitternecessity have taught me that
krogstad ,krogstad  and life has taught me not to believe in fine speeches
mrslinde ,mrslinde  then life has taught you something very reasonable  butdeeds you must believe in
krogstad ,krogstad  what do you mean by that
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you said you were like a shipwrecked man clinging to somewreckage
krogstad ,krogstad  i had good reason to say so
mrslinde ,mrslinde  well  i am like a shipwrecked woman clinging to somewreckage  no one to mourn for  no one to care for
krogstad ,krogstad  it was your own choice
mrslinde ,mrslinde  there was no other choice  then
krogstad ,krogstad  well  what now
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nils  how would it be if we two shipwrecked people couldjoin forces
krogstad ,krogstad  what are you saying
mrslinde ,mrslinde  two on the same piece of wreckage would stand a betterchance than each on their own
krogstad ,krogstad  christine i
mrslinde ,mrslinde  what do you suppose brought me to town
krogstad ,krogstad  do you mean that you gave me a thought
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i could not endure life without work  all my life  as longas i can remember  i have worked  and it has been my greatest andonly pleasure  but now i am quite alone in the world  my life is sodreadfully empty and i feel so forsaken  there is not the least pleasurein working for one s self  nils  give me someone and something to workfor
krogstad ,krogstad  i don t trust that  it is nothing but a woman s overstrainedsense of generosity that prompts you to make such an offer of yourself
mrslinde ,mrslinde  have you ever noticed anything of the sort in me
krogstad ,krogstad  could you really do it  tell me  do you know all about my pastlife
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes
krogstad ,krogstad  and do you know what they think of me here
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you seemed to me to imply that with me you might have beenquite another man
krogstad ,krogstad  i am certain of it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  is it too late now
krogstad ,krogstad  christine  are you saying this deliberately  yes  i am sureyou are  i see it in your face  have you really the courage  then
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i want to be a mother to someone  and your children needa mother  we two need each other  nils  i have faith in your realcharacter  i can dare anything together with you
krogstad ,krogstad   thanks  thanks  christine  now i shall finda way to clear myself in the eyes of the world  ah  but i forgot
mrs ,mrs  linde   hush  the tarantella  go  go
krogstad ,krogstad  why  what is it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  do you hear them up there  when that is over  we may expectthem back
krogstad ,krogstad  yes  yes  i will go  but it is all no use  of course you arenot aware what steps i have taken in the matter of the helmers
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  i know all about that
krogstad ,krogstad  and in spite of that have you the courage to
mrslinde ,mrslinde  i understand very well to what lengths a man like you mightbe driven by despair
krogstad ,krogstad  if i could only undo what i have done
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you cannot  your letter is lying in the letter box now
krogstad ,krogstad  are you sure of that
mrslinde ,mrslinde  quite sure  but
krogstad ,krogstad   is that what it allmeans   that you want to save your friend at any cost  tell me frankly is that it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nils  a woman who has once sold herself for another s sake doesn t do it a second time
krogstad ,krogstad  i will ask for my letter back
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  no
krogstad ,krogstad  yes  of course i will  i will wait here until helmer comes  iwill tell him he must give me my letter back  that it only concerns mydismissal  that he is not to read it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  no  nils  you must not recall your letter
krogstad ,krogstad  but  tell me  wasn t it for that very purpose that you askedme to meet you here
mrslinde ,mrslinde  in my first moment of fright  it was  but twenty four hourshave elapsed since then  and in that time i have witnessed incrediblethings in this house  helmer must know all about it  this unhappy secretmust be disclosed  they must have a complete understanding between them which is impossible with all this concealment and falsehood going on
krogstad ,krogstad  very well  if you will take the responsibility  but there isone thing i can do in any case  and i shall do it at once
mrs ,mrs  linde   you must be quick and go  the dance is over  weare not safe a moment longer
krogstad ,krogstad  i will wait for you below
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  do  you must see me back to my door
krogstad ,krogstad  i have never had such an amazing piece of good fortune in mylife
mrs ,mrs  linde  what a difference  what a difference  someone to work for and livefor  a home to bring comfort into  that i will do  indeed  i wish theywould be quick and come   ah  there they are now  i must puton my things
nora ,nora   no  no no   don t take me in  i want to go upstairs again  i don t want toleave so early
helmer ,helmer  but  my dearest nora

mrslinde ,mrslinde  good evening
nora ,nora  christine
helmer ,helmer  you here  so late  mrs  linde
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  you must excuse me  i was so anxious to see nora in herdress
nora ,nora  have you been sitting here waiting for me
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  unfortunately i came too late  you had already goneupstairs  and i thought i couldn t go away again without having seenyou
helmer ,helmer   yes  take a good look at her  i thinkshe is worth looking at  isn t she charming  mrs  linde
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  indeed she is
helmer ,helmer  doesn t she look remarkably pretty  everyone thought so at thedance  but she is terribly self willed  this sweet little person  whatare we to do with her  you will hardly believe that i had almost tobring her away by force
nora ,nora  torvald  you will repent not having let me stay  even if it wereonly for half an hour
helmer ,helmer  listen to her  mrs  linde  she had danced her tarantella  andit had been a tremendous success  as it deserved  although possibly theperformance was a trifle too realistic  a little more so  i mean  thanwas strictly compatible with the limitations of art  but never mindabout that  the chief thing is  she had made a success  she had madea tremendous success  do you think i was going to let her remain thereafter that  and spoil the effect  no  indeed  i took my charming littlecapri maiden  my capricious little capri maiden  i should say  on myarm  took one quick turn round the room  a curtsey on either side  and as they say in novels  the beautiful apparition disappeared  an exitought always to be effective  mrs  linde  but that is what i cannot makenora understand  pooh  this room is hot   hullo  it s all dark in here  oh  ofcourse  excuse me
nora ,nora   well
mrs ,mrs  linde   i have had a talk with him
nora ,nora  yes  and
mrslinde ,mrslinde  nora  you must tell your husband all about it
nora ,nora   i knew it
mrslinde ,mrslinde  you have nothing to be afraid of as far as krogstad isconcerned  but you must tell him
nora ,nora  i won t tell him
mrslinde ,mrslinde  then the letter will
nora ,nora  thank you  christine  now i know what i must do  hush
helmer ,helmer   well  mrs  linde  have you admired her
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  and now i will say goodnight

helmer ,helmer  so you knit
mrslinde ,mrslinde  of course
helmer ,helmer  do you know  you ought to embroider
mrslinde ,mrslinde  really  why
helmer ,helmer  yes  it s far more becoming  let me show you  you holdthe embroidery thus in your left hand  and use the needle with theright  like this  with a long  easy sweep  do you see
mrslinde ,mrslinde  yes  perhaps
helmer ,helmer  but in the case of knitting  that can never be anything butungraceful  look here  the arms close together  the knitting needlesgoing up and down  it has a sort of chinese effect    that was reallyexcellent champagne they gave us
mrslinde ,mrslinde  well   goodnight  nora  and don t be self willed any more
helmer ,helmer  that s right  mrs  linde
mrslinde ,mrslinde  goodnight  mr  helmer
helmer ,helmer   goodnight  goodnight  i hope youwill get home all right  i should be very happy to  but you haven t anygreat distance to go  goodnight  goodnight   ah   at last we have got rid ofher  she is a frightful bore  that woman
nora ,nora  aren t you very tired  torvald
helmer ,helmer  no  not in the least

nora ,nora  yes  i am very tired  i want to go to sleep at once
helmer ,helmer  there  you see it was quite right of me not to let you staythere any longer
nora ,nora  everything you do is quite right  torvald
helmer ,helmer   now my little skylark is speakingreasonably  did you notice what good spirits rank was in this evening
nora ,nora  really  was he  i didn t speak to him at all
helmer ,helmer  and i very little  but i have not for a long time seen him insuch good form  it is delightful to be at home by ourselves again  to be all alone withyou  you fascinating  charming little darling
nora ,nora  don t look at me like that  torvald
helmer ,helmer  why shouldn t i look at my dearest treasure   at all the beautythat is mine  all my very own

helmer ,helmer   you have still got the tarantella in your blood i see  and it makes you more captivating than ever  listen  the guestsare beginning to go now   nora  soon the whole housewill be quiet
nora ,nora  yes  i hope so
helmer ,helmer  yes  my own darling nora  do you know  when i am out at a partywith you like this  why i speak so little to you  keep away from you and only send a stolen glance in your direction now and then   do youknow why i do that  it is because i make believe to myself that we aresecretly in love  and you are my secretly promised bride  and that noone suspects there is anything between us
nora ,nora  yes  yes  i know very well your thoughts are with me all the time
helmer ,helmer  and when we are leaving  and i am putting the shawl over yourbeautiful young shoulders  on your lovely neck  then i imagine that youare my young bride and that we have just come from the wedding  and i ambringing you for the first time into our home  to be alone with you forthe first time  quite alone with my shy little darling  all this eveningi have longed for nothing but you  when i watched the seductive figuresof the tarantella  my blood was on fire  i could endure it no longer and that was why i brought you down so early

helmer ,helmer  it seems to me that you looked after yourself pretty wellupstairs too
rank ,rank  excellently  why shouldn t i  why shouldn t one enjoy everythingin this world   at any rate as much as one can  and as long as one can the wine was capital
helmer ,helmer  especially the champagne
rank ,rank  so you noticed that too  it is almost incredible how much imanaged to put away
nora ,nora  torvald drank a great deal of champagne tonight too
rank ,rank  did he
nora ,nora  yes  and he is always in such good spirits afterwards
rank ,rank  well  why should one not enjoy a merry evening after a well spentday
helmer ,helmer  well spent  i am afraid i can t take credit for that
rank ,rank   but i can  you know

helmer ,helmer  little featherbrain   are you thinking of the next already
rank ,rank  we two  yes  i can tell you  you shall go as a good fairy
helmer ,helmer  yes  but what do you suggest as an appropriate costume for that
rank ,rank  let your wife go dressed just as she is in everyday life
helmer ,helmer  that was really very prettily turned  but can t you tell us whatyou will be
rank ,rank  yes  my dear friend  i have quite made up my mind about that
helmer ,helmer  well

nora ,nora  at the lock
helmer ,helmer  yes  someone has  what can it mean  i should never have thoughtthe maid    here is a broken hairpin  nora  it is one of yours

nora ,nora  is there anything written on them
helmer ,helmer  there is a black cross over the name  look there  what anuncomfortable idea  it looks as if he were announcing his own death
nora ,nora  it is just what he is doing
helmer ,helmer  what  do you know anything about it  has he said anything toyou
nora ,nora  yes  he told me that when the cards came it would be hisleave taking from us  he means to shut himself up and die
helmer ,helmer  my poor old friend  certainly i knew we should not have him verylong with us  but so soon  and so he hides himself away like a woundedanimal
nora ,nora  if it has to happen  it is best it should be without a word  don tyou think so  torvald
helmer ,helmer   he had so grown into our lives  i can tthink of him as having gone out of them  he  with his sufferings and hisloneliness  was like a cloudy background to our sunlit happiness  well perhaps it is best so  for him  anyway   and perhapsfor us too  nora  we two are thrown quite upon each other now   my darling wife  i don t feel as if i could hold youtight enough  do you know  nora  i have often wished that you might bethreatened by some great danger  so that i might risk my life s blood and everything  for your sake
nora ,nora   now you mustread your letters  torvald
helmer ,helmer  no  no  not tonight  i want to be with you  my darling wife
nora ,nora  with the thought of your friend s death
helmer ,helmer  you are right  it has affected us both  something ugly has comebetween us  the thought of the horrors of death  we must try and rid ourminds of that  until then  we will each go to our own room

nora ,nora   yes  now i am beginning to understand thoroughly
helmer ,helmer   what a horrible awakening  all theseeight years  she who was my joy and pride  a hypocrite  a liar  worse worse  a criminal  the unutterable ugliness of it all   for shame  forshame   i ought to have suspected that something of the sort would happen i ought to have foreseen it  all your father s want of principle  besilent   all your father s want of principle has come out in you  noreligion  no morality  no sense of duty    how i am punished for havingwinked at what he did  i did it for your sake  and this is how you repayme
nora ,nora  yes  that s just it
helmer ,helmer  now you have destroyed all my happiness  you have ruined all myfuture  it is horrible to think of  i am in the power of an unscrupulousman  he can do what he likes with me  ask anything he likes of me  giveme any orders he pleases  i dare not refuse  and i must sink to suchmiserable depths because of a thoughtless woman
nora ,nora  when i am out of the way  you will be free
helmer ,helmer  no fine speeches  please  your father had always plenty of thoseready  too  what good would it be to me if you were out of the way  asyou say  not the slightest  he can make the affair known everywhere  andif he does  i may be falsely suspected of having been a party to yourcriminal action  very likely people will think i was behind it all  thatit was i who prompted you  and i have to thank you for all this  youwhom i have cherished during the whole of our married life  do youunderstand now what it is you have done for me
nora ,nora   yes
helmer ,helmer  it is so incredible that i can t take it in  but we must come tosome understanding  take off that shawl  take it off  i tell you  i musttry and appease him some way or another  the matter must be hushed up atany cost  and as for you and me  it must appear as if everything betweenus were just as before  but naturally only in the eyes of the world  youwill still remain in my house  that is a matter of course  but i shallnot allow you to bring up the children  i dare not trust them to you to think that i should be obliged to say so to one whom i have lovedso dearly  and whom i still    no  that is all over  from this momenthappiness is not the question  all that concerns us is to save theremains  the fragments  the appearance
helmer ,helmer   what is that  so late  can the worst    can he   hide yourself  nora  say you are ill

nora ,nora  i have fought a hard fight these three days
helmer ,helmer  and suffered agonies  and seen no way out but    no  we won tcall any of the horrors to mind  we will only shout with joy  and keepsaying   it s all over  it s all over   listen to me  nora  you don tseem to realise that it is all over  what is this   such a cold  setface  my poor little nora  i quite understand  you don t feel as if youcould believe that i have forgiven you  but it is true  nora  i swearit  i have forgiven you everything  i know that what you did  you didout of love for me
nora ,nora  that is true
helmer ,helmer  you have loved me as a wife ought to love her husband  only youhad not sufficient knowledge to judge of the means you used  but do yousuppose you are any the less dear to me  because you don t understandhow to act on your own responsibility  no  no  only lean on me  iwill advise you and direct you  i should not be a man if this womanlyhelplessness did not just give you a double attractiveness in my eyes you must not think anymore about the hard things i said in my firstmoment of consternation  when i thought everything was going tooverwhelm me  i have forgiven you  nora  i swear to you i have forgivenyou

nora ,nora   yes  torvald  i have changed my things now
helmer ,helmer  but what for   so late as this
nora ,nora  i shall not sleep tonight
helmer ,helmer  but  my dear nora
nora ,nora   it is not so very late  sit down here torvald  you and i have much to say to one another
helmer ,helmer  nora  what is this   this cold  set face
nora ,nora  sit down  it will take some time  i have a lot to talk over withyou
helmer ,helmer   you alarm me nora   and i don t understand you
nora ,nora  no  that is just it  you don t understand me  and i have neverunderstood you either  before tonight  no  you mustn t interrupt me you must simply listen to what i say  torvald  this is a settling ofaccounts
helmer ,helmer  what do you mean by that
nora ,nora   isn t there one thing that strikes you asstrange in our sitting here like this
helmer ,helmer  what is that
nora ,nora  we have been married now eight years  does it not occur to youthat this is the first time we two  you and i  husband and wife  havehad a serious conversation
helmer ,helmer  what do you mean by serious
nora ,nora  in all these eight years  longer than that  from the verybeginning of our acquaintance  we have never exchanged a word on anyserious subject
helmer ,helmer  was it likely that i would be continually and forever tellingyou about worries that you could not help me to bear
nora ,nora  i am not speaking about business matters  i say that we have neversat down in earnest together to try and get at the bottom of anything
helmer ,helmer  but  dearest nora  would it have been any good to you
nora ,nora  that is just it  you have never understood me  i have been greatlywronged  torvald  first by papa and then by you
helmer ,helmer  what  by us two  by us two  who have loved you better thananyone else in the world
nora ,nora   you have never loved me  you have only thoughtit pleasant to be in love with me
helmer ,helmer  nora  what do i hear you saying
nora ,nora  it is perfectly true  torvald  when i was at home with papa  hetold me his opinion about everything  and so i had the same opinions and if i differed from him i concealed the fact  because he would nothave liked it  he called me his doll child  and he played with me justas i used to play with my dolls  and when i came to live with you
helmer ,helmer  what sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage
nora ,nora   i mean that i was simply transferred from papa shands into yours  you arranged everything according to your own taste and so i got the same tastes as your else i pretended to  i am reallynot quite sure which  i think sometimes the one and sometimes the other when i look back on it  it seems to me as if i had been living here likea poor woman  just from hand to mouth  i have existed merely to performtricks for you  torvald  but you would have it so  you and papa havecommitted a great sin against me  it is your fault that i have madenothing of my life
helmer ,helmer  how unreasonable and how ungrateful you are  nora  have you notbeen happy here
nora ,nora  no  i have never been happy  i thought i was  but it has neverreally been so
helmer ,helmer  not  not happy
nora ,nora  no  only merry  and you have always been so kind to me  but ourhome has been nothing but a playroom  i have been your doll wife  justas at home i was papa s doll child  and here the children have beenmy dolls  i thought it great fun when you played with me  just as theythought it great fun when i played with them  that is what our marriagehas been  torvald
helmer ,helmer  there is some truth in what you say  exaggerated and strained asyour view of it is  but for the future it shall be different  playtimeshall be over  and lesson time shall begin
nora ,nora  whose lessons  mine  or the children s
helmer ,helmer  both yours and the children s  my darling nora
nora ,nora  alas  torvald  you are not the man to educate me into being aproper wife for you
helmer ,helmer  and you can say that
nora ,nora  and i  how am i fitted to bring up the children
helmer ,helmer  nora
nora ,nora  didn t you say so yourself a little while ago  that you dare nottrust me to bring them up
helmer ,helmer  in a moment of anger  why do you pay any heed to that
nora ,nora  indeed  you were perfectly right  i am not fit for the task there is another task i must undertake first  i must try and educatemyself  you are not the man to help me in that  i must do that formyself  and that is why i am going to leave you now
helmer ,helmer   what do you say
nora ,nora  i must stand quite alone  if i am to understand myself andeverything about me  it is for that reason that i cannot remain with youany longer
helmer ,helmer  nora  nora
nora ,nora  i am going away from here now  at once  i am sure christine willtake me in for the night
helmer ,helmer  you are out of your mind  i won t allow it  i forbid you
nora ,nora  it is no use forbidding me anything any longer  i will take withme what belongs to myself  i will take nothing from you  either now orlater
helmer ,helmer  what sort of madness is this
nora ,nora  tomorrow i shall go home  i mean  to my old home  it will beeasiest for me to find something to do there
helmer ,helmer  you blind  foolish woman
nora ,nora  i must try and get some sense  torvald
helmer ,helmer  to desert your home  your husband and your children  and youdon t consider what people will say
nora ,nora  i cannot consider that at all  i only know that it is necessaryfor me
helmer ,helmer  it s shocking  this is how you would neglect your most sacredduties
nora ,nora  what do you consider my most sacred duties
helmer ,helmer  do i need to tell you that  are they not your duties to yourhusband and your children
nora ,nora  i have other duties just as sacred
helmer ,helmer  that you have not  what duties could those be
nora ,nora  duties to myself
helmer ,helmer  before all else  you are a wife and a mother
nora ,nora  i don t believe that any longer  i believe that before all else iam a reasonable human being  just as you are  or  at all events  thati must try and become one  i know quite well  torvald  that most peoplewould think you right  and that views of that kind are to be found inbooks  but i can no longer content myself with what most people say  orwith what is found in books  i must think over things for myself and getto understand them
helmer ,helmer  can you not understand your place in your own home  have you nota reliable guide in such matters as that   have you no religion
nora ,nora  i am afraid  torvald  i do not exactly know what religion is
helmer ,helmer  what are you saying
nora ,nora  i know nothing but what the clergyman said  when i went to beconfirmed  he told us that religion was this  and that  and the other when i am away from all this  and am alone  i will look into that mattertoo  i will see if what the clergyman said is true  or at all events ifit is true for me
helmer ,helmer  this is unheard of in a girl of your age  but if religion cannotlead you aright  let me try and awaken your conscience  i suppose youhave some moral sense  or  answer me  am i to think you have none
nora ,nora  i assure you  torvald  that is not an easy question to answer  ireally don t know  the thing perplexes me altogether  i only know thatyou and i look at it in quite a different light  i am learning  too that the law is quite another thing from what i supposed  but i find itimpossible to convince myself that the law is right  according to ita woman has no right to spare her old dying father  or to save herhusband s life  i can t believe that
helmer ,helmer  you talk like a child  you don t understand the conditions ofthe world in which you live
nora ,nora  no  i don t  but now i am going to try  i am going to see if i canmake out who is right  the world or i
helmer ,helmer  you are ill  nora  you are delirious  i almost think you are outof your mind
nora ,nora  i have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight
helmer ,helmer  and is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake yourhusband and your children
nora ,nora  yes  it is
helmer ,helmer  then there is only one possible explanation
nora ,nora  what is that
helmer ,helmer  you do not love me anymore
nora ,nora  no  that is just it
helmer ,helmer  nora   and you can say that
nora ,nora  it gives me great pain  torvald  for you have always been so kindto me  but i cannot help it  i do not love you any more
helmer ,helmer   is that a clear and certain convictiontoo
nora ,nora  yes  absolutely clear and certain  that is the reason why i willnot stay here any longer
helmer ,helmer  and can you tell me what i have done to forfeit your love
nora ,nora  yes  indeed i can  it was tonight  when the wonderful thing didnot happen  then i saw you were not the man i had thought you were
helmer ,helmer  explain yourself better  i don t understand you
nora ,nora  i have waited so patiently for eight years  for  goodness knows i knew very well that wonderful things don t happen every day  then thishorrible misfortune came upon me  and then i felt quite certain that thewonderful thing was going to happen at last  when krogstad s letter waslying out there  never for a moment did i imagine that you would consentto accept this man s conditions  i was so absolutely certain that youwould say to him  publish the thing to the whole world  and when thatwas done
helmer ,helmer  yes  what then   when i had exposed my wife to shame anddisgrace
nora ,nora  when that was done  i was so absolutely certain  you would comeforward and take everything upon yourself  and say  i am the guilty one
helmer ,helmer  nora
nora ,nora  you mean that i would never have accepted such a sacrifice on yourpart  no  of course not  but what would my assurances have been worthagainst yours  that was the wonderful thing which i hoped for andfeared  and it was to prevent that  that i wanted to kill myself
helmer ,helmer  i would gladly work night and day for you  nora  bear sorrow andwant for your sake  but no man would sacrifice his honour for the one heloves
nora ,nora  it is a thing hundreds of thousands of women have done
helmer ,helmer  oh  you think and talk like a heedless child
nora ,nora  maybe  but you neither think nor talk like the man i could bindmyself to  as soon as your fear was over  and it was not fear for whatthreatened me  but for what might happen to you  when the whole thingwas past  as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing atall had happened  exactly as before  i was your little skylark  yourdoll  which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care  becauseit was so brittle and fragile   torvald  it was thenit dawned upon me that for eight years i had been living here with astrange man  and had borne him three children    oh  i can t bear tothink of it  i could tear myself into little bits
helmer ,helmer   i see  i see  an abyss has opened between us  there isno denying it  but  nora  would it not be possible to fill it up
nora ,nora  as i am now  i am no wife for you
helmer ,helmer  i have it in me to become a different man
nora ,nora  perhaps  if your doll is taken away from you
helmer ,helmer  but to part   to part from you  no  no  nora  i can t understandthat idea
nora ,nora   that makes it all the more certain thatit must be done
helmer ,helmer  nora  nora  not now  wait until tomorrow
nora ,nora   i cannot spend the night in a strange man sroom
helmer ,helmer  but can t we live here like brother and sister
nora ,nora   you know very well that would not last long  goodbye  torvald  i won t see the littleones  i know they are in better hands than mine  as i am now  i can beof no use to them
helmer ,helmer  but some day  nora  some day
nora ,nora  how can i tell  i have no idea what is going to become of me
helmer ,helmer  but you are my wife  whatever becomes of you
nora ,nora  listen  torvald  i have heard that when a wife deserts herhusband s house  as i am doing now  he is legally freed from allobligations towards her  in any case  i set you free from all yourobligations  you are not to feel yourself bound in the slightest way any more than i shall  there must be perfect freedom on both sides  see here is your ring back  give me mine
helmer ,helmer  that too
nora ,nora  that too
helmer ,helmer  here it is
nora ,nora  that s right  now it is all over  i have put the keys here the maids know all about everything in the house  better than i do tomorrow  after i have left her  christine will come here and pack up myown things that i brought with me from home  i will have them sent afterme
helmer ,helmer  all over  all over   nora  shall you never think of me again
nora ,nora  i know i shall often think of you  the children  and this house
helmer ,helmer  may i write to you  nora
nora ,nora  no  never  you must not do that
helmer ,helmer  but at least let me send you
nora ,nora  nothing  nothing
helmer ,helmer  let me help you if you are in want
nora ,nora  no  i can receive nothing from a stranger
helmer ,helmer  nora  can i never be anything more than a stranger to you
nora ,nora   ah  torvald  the most wonderful thing of allwould have to happen
helmer ,helmer  tell me what that would be
nora ,nora  both you and i would have to be so changed that    oh  torvald  idon t believe any longer in wonderful things happening
helmer ,helmer  but i will believe in it  tell me  so changed that
nora ,nora  that our life together would be a real wedlock  goodbye
helmer ,helmer   nora  nora   empty  she is gone   the most wonderful thing of all
