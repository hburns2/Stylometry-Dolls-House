Look at all words and think of them as mapped into groups (i.e. verbs, prepositions) --> are they different or is there a subgroup
Row num will be x-axis, filter just Nora

Might want to normalize to plot nora and helmer next to each other

Keep original line number --> way of checking nora and helmer not same line
y-axis = probability of nora

look to see if straight line

precision and recall in norweigan v english
which is more distinguishable
using probabilities, what is the temporal things happening

Towards the end, who's line is it, versus at the beginning?
Null is that there is no temporal trend -- there should be a straight line
fit regression
	y = a+bx
	y = a+bx+cx
	
For english version, regression line per person
Look at confusion matrix --> see which people look like each other and which look different

think about 3 questions
can tell apart --> within language, between language (precision v recall)
does that depend on language (for each of these questions)
	if easy to tell apart in english not norw --> could hypothesize whether this is because of language or translator
which characters are hard to tell apart, which are easy (confusion matrix)
are there any temporal trends?

* broaded the norw one to have a few more words
are there certain words that ARE a character
formal vs friendly words (think french)
