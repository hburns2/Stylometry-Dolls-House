# Stylometry-Dolls-House

Building off of a previous project involving playscripts, I will be using stylometry to investigate the differences between original work and translations of Ibsen's "A Doll's House." This will involve inspecting the temporal aspects of the play itself (both in English and Norwegian) and investigating characters' speech style-changes and arcs. Ultimately, I will be investigating how the style of character vs playwright vs translator differ and if it is possible to predict who said which line in the separate languages.

2 initial datasets will be created. One, detailing the character's name with their corresponding line. The other, after having extracted the most-common phrases utilized in the play (as well as eliminating potential subject words), will detail how many times each word was used in each person's line. This will ultimately create the characters' profiles, which can then be tracked across the script in its entirety.
