weeks\\nbeforehand you shut yourself up every evening until long after midnight \\nmaking ornaments for the christmas tree  and all the other fine things\\nthat were to be a surprise to us  it was the

help the\\ncat s going in and tearing everything to pieces \\n', 'helmer  of course you couldn t  poor little girl  you had the best of\\nintentions to please us all  and that s the main thing  but it is a good\\nthing that our hard times are over \\n', 'nora  yes  it is really wonderful \\n', 'helmer  this time i needn t sit here and be dull all alone  and you\\nneedn t ruin your dear eyes and your pretty little hands  \\n', 'nora   no  torvald  i needn t any longer  need i \\nit s wonderfully lovely to hear you say so   now i will\\ntell you how i have been thinking we ought to arrange

to see you  ma am   a stranger \\n', 'nora  ask her to come in \\n', 'maid   the doctor came at the same time  sir \\n', 'helmer  did he go straight into my room \\n', 'maid  yes  sir \\n', ' mrs

\\n', 'mrslinde  yes  it is i \\n', 'nora  christine  to think of my not recognising you  and yet how could\\ni   how you have altered  christine \\n', 'mrslinde  yes  i have indeed  in nine  ten long years  \\n', 'nora  is it so long since we met  i suppose it is  the last eight years\\nhave been a happy time for me  i can tell you  and so now you have come\\ninto the town  and have taken this long journey in winter  that was\\nplucky of you \\n', 'mrslinde  i arrived by steamer this morning \\n', 'nora  to have some fun at christmas time  of course  how delightful  we\\nwill have such fun together  but take off your things  you are not cold \\ni hope   now we will sit down by the stove  and be cosy \\nno  take this armchair  i will sit here in the rocking chair   now you look like your old self again  it was only the first\\nmoment  you are a little paler  christine  and perhaps a little thinner \\n', 'mrslinde  and much  much older  nora \\n', 'nora  perhaps a little older  very  very little  certainly not much \\n what a thoughtless creature i am \\nchattering away like this  my poor  dear christine  do forgive me \\n', 'mrslinde  what do you mean  nora \\n', 'nora   poor christine  you are a widow \\n', 'mrslinde  yes  it is three years ago now \\n', 'nora  yes  i knew  i saw it in the papers  i assure you  christine  i\\nmeant ever so often to write to you at the time  but i always put it off\\nand something always prevented me \\n', 'mrslinde  i quite understand  dear \\n', 'nora  it was very bad of me  christine  poor thing  how you must have\\nsuffered  and he left you nothing \\n', 'mrslinde  no \\n', 'nora  and no children \\n', 'mrslinde  no \\n', 'nora  nothing at all  then \\n', 'mrslinde  not even any sorrow or grief to live upon \\n', 'nora   but  christine  is that possible \\n', 'mrs  linde   it sometimes happens \\nnora \\n', 'nora  so you are quite alone  how dreadfully sad that must be  i have\\nthree lovely children  you can t see them just now  for they are out\\nwith their nurse  but now you must tell me all about it \\n', 'mrslinde  no  no  i want to hear about you \\n', 'nora  no  you must begin  i mustn t be selfish today  today i must only\\nthink of your affairs  but there is one thing i must tell you  do you\\nknow we have just had a great piece of good luck \\n', 'mrslinde  no  what is it \\n', 'nora  just fancy  my husband has been made manager of the bank \\n', 'mrslinde  your husband  what good luck \\n', 'nora  yes  tremendous  a barrister s profession is such an uncertain\\nthing  especially if he won t undertake unsavoury cases  and naturally\\ntorvald has never been willing to do that  and i quite agree with him \\nyou may imagine how pleased we are  he is to take up his work in the\\nbank at the new year  and then he will have a big salary and lots of\\ncommissions  for the future we can live quite differently  we can do\\njust as we like  i feel so relieved and so happy  christine  it will be\\nsplendid to have heaps of money and not need to have any anxiety  won t\\nit \\n', 'mrslinde  yes  anyhow i think it would be delightful to have what one\\nneeds \\n', 'nora  no  not only what one needs  but heaps and heaps of money \\n', 'mrs  linde   nora  nora  haven t you learned sense yet  in our\\nschooldays you were a great spendthrift \\n', 'nora   yes  that is what torvald says now   but  nora  nora  is not so silly as you think  we have not been in\\na position for me to waste money  we have both had to work \\n', 'mrslinde  you too \\n', 'nora  yes  odds and ends  needlework  crotchet work  embroidery  and\\nthat kind of thing   and other things as well  you\\nknow torvald left his office when we were married  there was no prospect\\nof promotion there  and he had to try and earn more than before  but\\nduring the first year he over worked himself dreadfully  you see  he had\\nto make money every way he could  and he worked early and late  but he\\ncouldn t stand it  and fell dreadfully ill  and the doctors said it was\\nnecessary for him to go south \\n', 'mrslinde  you spent a whole year in italy  didn t you \\n', 'nora  yes  it was no easy matter to get away  i can tell you  it\\nwas just after ivar was born  but naturally we had to go  it was a\\nwonderfully beautiful journey  and it saved torvald s life  but it cost\\na tremendous lot of money  christine \\n', 'mrslinde  so i should think \\n', 'nora  it cost about two hundred and fifty pounds  that s a lot  isn t\\nit \\n', 'mrslinde  yes  and in emergencies like that it is lucky to have the\\nmoney \\n', 'nora  i ought to tell you that we had it from papa \\n', 'mrslinde  oh  i see  it was just about that time that he died  wasn t\\nit \\n', 'nora  yes  and  just think of it  i couldn t go and nurse him  i was\\nexpecting little ivar s birth every day and i had my poor sick torvald\\nto look after  my dear  kind father  i never saw him again  christine \\nthat was the saddest time i have known since our marriage \\n', 'mrslinde  i know how fond you were of him  and then you went off to\\nitaly \\n', 'nora  yes  you see we had money then  and the doctors insisted on our\\ngoing  so we started a month later \\n', 'mrslinde  and your husband came back quite well \\n', 'nora  as sound as a bell \\n', 'mrslinde  but  the doctor \\n', 'nora  what doctor \\n', 'mrslinde  i thought your maid said the gentleman who arrived here just\\nas i did  was the doctor \\n', 'nora  yes  that was doctor rank  but he doesn t come here\\nprofessionally  he is our greatest friend  and comes in at least once\\nevery day  no  torvald has not had an hour s illness since then  and our\\nchildren are strong and healthy and so am i   christine  christine  it s good to be alive and happy   but how\\nhorrid of me  i am talking of nothing but my own affairs   you mustn t be angry\\nwith me  tell me  is it really true that you did not love your husband \\nwhy did you marry him \\n', 'mrslinde  my mother was alive then  and was bedridden and helpless \\nand i had to provide for my two younger brothers  so i did not think i\\nwas justified in refusing his offer \\n', 'nora  no  perhaps you were quite right  he was rich at that time  then \\n', 'mrslinde  i believe he was quite well off  but his business was a\\nprecarious one  and  when he died  it all went to pieces and there was\\nnothing left \\n', 'nora  and then   \\n', 'mrslinde  well  i had to turn my hand to anything i could find  first\\na small shop  then a small school  and so on  the last three years have\\nseemed like one long working day  with no rest  now it is at an end \\nnora  my poor mother needs me no more  for she is gone  and the boys\\ndo not need me either  they have got situations and can shift for\\nthemselves \\n', 'nora  what a relief you must feel if  \\n', 'mrslinde  no  indeed  i only feel my life unspeakably empty  no one to\\nlive for anymore   that was why i could not stand\\nthe life in my little backwater any longer  i hope it may be easier here\\nto find something which will busy me and occupy my thoughts  if only i\\ncould have the good luck to get some regular work  office work of some\\nkind  \\n', 'nora  but  christine  that is so frightfully tiring  and you look tired\\nout now  you had far better go away to some watering place \\n', 'mrs  linde   i have no father to give me money\\nfor a journey  nora \\n', 'nora   oh  don t be angry with me \\n', 'mrs  linde   it is you that must not be angry with me \\ndear  the worst of a position like mine is that it makes one so bitter \\nno one to work for  and yet obliged to be always on the lookout for\\nchances  one must live  and so one becomes selfish  when you told me of\\nthe happy turn your fortunes have taken  you will hardly believe it  i\\nwas delighted not so much on your account as on my own \\n', 'nora  how do you mean   oh  i understand  you mean that perhaps torvald\\ncould get you something to do \\n', 'mrslinde  yes  that was what i was thinking of \\n', 'nora  he must  christine  just leave it to me  i will broach the subject\\nvery cleverly  i will think of something that will please him very much \\nit will make me so happy to be of some use to you \\n', 'mrslinde  how kind you are  nora  to be so anxious to help me  it is\\ndoubly kind in you  for you know so little of the burdens and troubles\\nof life \\n', 'nora  i    i know so little of them \\n', 'mrs  linde   my dear  small household cares and that sort of\\nthing   you are a child  nora \\n', 'nora   you ought not to be so\\nsuperior \\n', 'mrslinde  no \\n', 'nora  you are just like the others  they all think that i am incapable\\nof anything really serious  \\n', 'mrslinde  come  come  \\n', 'nora   that i have gone through nothing in this world of cares \\n', 'mrslinde  but  my dear nora  you have just told me all your troubles \\n', 'nora  pooh   those were trifles   i have not told\\nyou the important thing \\n', 'mrslinde  the important thing  what do you mean \\n', 'nora  you look down upon me altogether  christine  but you ought not to \\nyou are proud  aren t you  of having worked so hard and so long for your\\nmother \\n', 'mrslinde  indeed  i don t look down on anyone  but it is true that i\\nam both proud and glad to think that i was privileged to make the end of\\nmy mother s life almost free from care \\n', 'nora  and you are proud to think of what you have done for your\\nbrothers \\n', 'mrslinde  i think i have the right to be \\n', 'nora  i think so  too  but now  listen to this  i too have something to\\nbe proud and glad of \\n', 'mrslinde  i have no doubt you have  but what do you refer to \\n', 'nora  speak low  suppose torvald were to hear  he mustn t on any\\naccount  no one in the world must know  christine  except you \\n', 'mrslinde  but what is it \\n', 'nora  come here   now i will\\nshow you that i too have something to be proud and glad of  it was i who\\nsaved torvald s life \\n', 'mrslinde   saved   how \\n', 'nora  i told you about our trip to italy  torvald would never have\\nrecovered if he had not gone there  \\n', 'mrslinde  yes  but your father gave you the necessary funds \\n', 'nora   yes  that is what torvald and all the others think \\nbut  \\n', 'mrslinde  but  \\n', 'nora  papa didn t give us a shilling  it was i who procured the money \\n', 'mrslinde  you  all that large sum \\n', 'nora  two hundred and fifty pounds  what do you think of that \\n', 'mrslinde  but  nora  how could you possibly do it  did you win a prize\\nin the lottery \\n', 'nora   in the lottery  there would have been no credit\\nin that \\n', 'mrslinde  but where did you get it from  then  nora   hm  hm  aha \\n', 'mrslinde  because you couldn t have borrowed it \\n', 'nora  couldn t i  why not \\n', 'mrslinde  no  a wife cannot borrow without her husband s consent \\n', 'nora   oh  if it is a wife who has any head for\\nbusiness  a wife who has the wit to be a little bit clever  \\n', 'mrslinde  i don t understand it at all  nora \\n', 'nora  there is no need you should  i never said i had borrowed the\\nmoney  i may have got it some other way  \\nperhaps i got it from some other admirer  when anyone is as attractive\\nas i am  \\n', 'mrslinde  you are a mad creature \\n', 'nora  now  you know you re full of curiosity  christine \\n', 'mrslinde  listen to me  nora dear  haven t you been a little bit\\nimprudent \\n', 'nora   is it imprudent to save your husband s life \\n', 'mrslinde  it seems to me imprudent  without his knowledge  to  \\n', 'nora  but it was absolutely necessary that he should not know  my\\ngoodness  can t you understand that  it was necessary he should have no\\nidea what a dangerous condition he was in  it was to me that the doctors\\ncame and said that his life was in danger  and that the only thing to\\nsave him was to live in the south  do you suppose i didn t try  first of\\nall  to get what i wanted as if it were for myself  i told him how much\\ni should love to travel abroad like other young wives  i tried tears and\\nentreaties with him  i told him that he ought to remember the condition\\ni was in  and that he ought to be kind and indulgent to me  i even\\nhinted that he might raise a loan  that nearly made him angry \\nchristine  he said i was thoughtless  and that it was his duty as my\\nhusband not to indulge me in my whims and caprices  as i believe he\\ncalled them  very well  i thought  you must be saved  and that was how i\\ncame to devise a way out of the difficulty  \\n', 'mrslinde  and did your husband never get to know from your father that\\nthe money had not come from him \\n', 'nora  no  never  papa died just at that time  i had meant to let him\\ninto the secret and beg him never to reveal it  but he was so ill\\nthen  alas  there never was any need to tell him \\n', 'mrslinde  and since then have you never told your secret to your\\nhusband \\n', 'nora  good heavens  no  how could you think so  a man who has such\\nstrong opinions about these things  and besides  how painful and\\nhumiliating it would be for torvald  with his manly independence  to\\nknow that he owed me anything  it would upset our mutual relations\\naltogether  our beautiful happy home would no longer be what it is now \\n', 'mrslinde  do you mean never to tell him about it \\n', 'nora   yes  someday  perhaps  after\\nmany years  when i am no longer as nice looking as i am now  don t laugh\\nat me  i mean  of course  when torvald is no longer as devoted to me as\\nhe is now  when my dancing and dressing up and reciting have palled on\\nhim  then it may be a good thing to have something in reserve   what nonsense  that time will never come  now  what do you think\\nof my great secret  christine  do you still think i am of no use  i can\\ntell you  too  that this affair has caused me a lot of worry  it has\\nbeen by no means easy for me to meet my engagements punctually  i may\\ntell you that there is something that is called  in business  quarterly\\ninterest  and another thing called payment in installments  and it is\\nalways so dreadfully difficult to manage them  i have had to save a\\nlittle here and there  where i could  you understand  i have not been\\nable to put aside much from my housekeeping money  for torvald must have\\na good table  i couldn t let my children be shabbily dressed  i have\\nfelt obliged to use up all he gave me for them  the sweet little\\ndarlings \\n', 'mrslinde  so it has all had to come out of your own necessaries of\\nlife  poor nora \\n', 'nora  of course  besides  i was the one responsible for it  whenever\\ntorvald has given me money for new dresses and such things  i have\\nnever spent more than half of it  i have always bought the simplest\\nand cheapest things  thank heaven  any clothes look well on me  and\\nso torvald has never noticed it  but it was often very hard on me \\nchristine  because it is delightful to be really well dressed  isn t it \\n', 'mrslinde  quite so \\n', 'nora  well  then i have found other ways of earning money  last winter\\ni was lucky enough to get a lot of copying to do  so i locked myself up\\nand sat writing every evening until quite late at night  many a time i\\nwas desperately tired  but all the same it was a tremendous pleasure to\\nsit there working and earning money  it was like being a man \\n', 'mrslinde  how much have you been able to pay off in that way \\n', 'nora  i can t tell you exactly  you see  it is very difficult to keep an\\naccount of a business matter of that kind  i only know that i have paid\\nevery penny that i could scrape together  many a time i was at my wits \\nend   then i used to sit here and imagine that a rich old\\ngentleman had fallen in love with me  \\n', 'mrslinde  what  who was it \\n', 'nora  be quiet   that he had died  and that when his will was opened\\nit contained  written in big letters  the instruction   the lovely mrs \\nnora helmer is to have all i possess paid over to her at once in cash  \\n', 'mrslinde  but  my dear nora  who could the man be \\n', 'nora  good gracious  can t you understand  there was no old gentleman at\\nall  it was only something that i used to sit here and imagine  when i\\ncouldn t think of any way of

 very likely  but  to come to the point  the time has come when\\ni should advise you to use your influence to prevent that \\n', 'nora  but  mr  krogstad  i have no influence \\n', 'krogstad  haven t you  i thought you said yourself just now  \\n', 'nora  naturally i did not mean you to put that construction on it  i \\nwhat should make you think i have any influence of that kind with my\\nhusband

'krogstad  it is not only for the sake of the money  indeed  that weighs\\nleast with me in the matter  there is another reason  well  i may as\\nwell tell you  my position is this  i daresay you know  like everybody\\nelse  that once  many years ago  i was guilty of an indiscretion \\n', 'nora  i think i have heard something of the kind \\n', 'krogstad  the matter never came into court  but every way seemed to be\\nclosed to me after that  so i took to the business that you know of  i\\nhad to do something  and  honestly  i don t think i ve been one of the\\nworst  but now i must cut myself free from all that  my sons are growing\\nup  for their sake i must try and win back as much respect as i can in\\nthe town  this post in the bank was like the first step up for me  and\\nnow your husband is going to kick me downstairs again into the mud \\n', 'nora  but you must believe me  mr  krogstad  it is not in my power to\\nhelp you at all \\n', 'krogstad  then it is because you haven t the will  but i have means to\\ncompel you \\n', 'nora  you don t mean that you will tell my husband that i owe you money \\n', 'krogstad  hm   suppose i were to tell him \\n', 'nora  it would be perfectly infamous of you   to think of his\\nlearning my secret  which has been my joy and pride  in such an ugly \\nclumsy way  that he should learn it from you  and it would put me in a\\nhorribly disagreeable position  \\n', 'krogstad  only disagreeable \\n', 'nora   well  do it  then   and it will be the worse for\\nyou  my husband will see for himself what a blackguard you are  and you\\ncertainly won t keep your post then \\n', 'krogstad  i asked you if it was only a disagreeable scene at home that\\nyou were afraid of \\n', 'nora  if my husband does get to know of it  of course he will at once\\npay you what is still owing  and we shall have nothing more to do with\\nyou \\n', 'krogstad   listen to me  mrs  helmer  either you\\nhave a very bad memory or you know very little of business  i shall be\\nobliged to remind you of a few details \\n', 'nora  what do you mean \\n', 'krogstad  when your husband was ill  you came to me to borrow two\\nhundred and fifty pounds \\n', 'nora  i didn t know anyone else to go to \\n', 'krogstad  i promised to get you that amount  \\n', 'nora  yes  and you did so \\n', 'krogstad  i promised to get you that amount  on certain conditions \\nyour mind was so taken up with your husband s illness  and you were so\\nanxious to get the money for your journey  that you seem to have paid\\nno attention to the conditions of our bargain  therefore it will not be\\namiss if i remind you of them  now  i promised to get the money on the\\nsecurity of a bond which i drew up \\n', 'nora  yes  and which i signed \\n', 'krogstad  good  but below your signature there were a few lines\\nconstituting your father a surety for the money  those lines your father\\nshould have signed \\n', 'nora  should  he did sign them \\n', 'krogstad  i had left the date blank  that is to say  your father should\\nhimself have inserted the date on which he signed the paper  do you\\nremember that \\n', 'nora  yes  i think i remember  \\n', 'krogstad  then i gave you the bond to send by post to your father  is\\nthat not so \\n', 'nora  yes \\n', 'krogstad  and you naturally did so at once  because five or six days\\nafterwards you brought me the bond with your father s signature  and\\nthen i gave you the money \\n', 'nora  well  haven t i been paying it off regularly \\n', 'krogstad  fairly so  yes  but  to come back to the matter in hand  that\\nmust have been a very trying time for you  mrs  helmer \\n', 'nora  it was  indeed \\n', 'krogstad  your father was very ill  wasn t he \\n', 'nora  he was very near his end \\n', 'krogstad  and died soon afterwards \\n', 'nora  yes \\n', 'krogstad  tell me  mrs  helmer  can you by any chance remember what day\\nyour father died   on what day of the month  i mean \\n', 'nora  papa died on the 29th of september \\n', 'krogstad  that is correct  i have ascertained it for myself  and  as\\nthat is so  there is a discrepancy \\nwhich i cannot account for \\n', 'nora  what discrepancy  i don t know  \\n', 'krogstad  the discrepancy consists  mrs  helmer  in the fact that your\\nfather signed this bond three days after his death \\n', 'nora  what do you mean  i don t understand  \\n', 'krogstad  your father died on the 29th of september  but  look here \\nyour father has dated his signature the 2nd of october  it is a\\ndiscrepancy  isn t it   can you explain it to me   it is a remarkable thing  too  that the words  2nd\\nof october   as well as the year  are not written in your father s\\nhandwriting but in one that i think i know  well  of course it can be\\nexplained  your father may have forgotten to date his signature  and\\nsomeone else may have dated it haphazard before they knew of his death \\nthere is no harm in that  it all depends on the signature of the name \\nand that is genuine  i suppose  mrs  helmer  it was your father himself\\nwho signed his name here \\n', 'nora   no  it was not  it was i that wrote papa s name \\n', 'krogstad  are you aware that is a dangerous confession \\n', 'nora  in what way  you shall have your money soon \\n', 'krogstad  let me ask you a question  why did you not send the paper to\\nyour father \\n', 'nora  it was impossible  papa was so ill  if i had asked him for his\\nsignature  i should have had to tell him what the money was to be\\nused for  and when he was so ill himself i couldn t tell him that my\\nhusband s life was in danger  it was impossible \\n', 'krogstad  it would have been better for you if you had given up your\\ntrip abroad \\n', 'nora  no  that was impossible  that trip was to save my husband s life \\ni couldn t give that up \\n', 'krogstad  but did it never occur to you that you were committing a fraud\\non me \\n', 'nora  i couldn t take that into account  i didn t trouble myself about\\nyou at all  i couldn t bear you  because you put so many heartless\\ndifficulties in my way  although you knew what a dangerous condition my\\nhusband was in \\n', 'krogstad  mrs  helmer  you evidently do not realise clearly what it is\\nthat you have been guilty of  but i can assure you that my one false\\nstep  which lost me all my reputation  was nothing more or nothing worse\\nthan what you have done \\n', 'nora  you  do you ask me to believe that you were brave enough to run a\\nrisk to save your wife s life \\n', 'krogstad  the law cares nothing about motives \\n', 'nora  then it must be a very foolish law \\n', 'krogstad  foolish or not  it is the law by which you will be judged  if\\ni produce this paper in court \\n', 'nora  i don t believe it  is a daughter not to be allowed to spare her\\ndying father anxiety and care  is a wife not to be allowed to save her\\nhusband s life  i don t know much about law  but i am certain that

torvald  i beg you so earnestly  \\n', 'helmer  have you really the courage to open up that question again \\n', 'nora  yes  dear  you must do as i ask  you must let krogstad keep his\\npost in the bank \\n', 'helmer  my dear nora  it is his post that i have arranged mrs  linde\\nshall have \\n', 'nora  yes  you have been awfully kind about that  but you could just as\\nwell dismiss some other clerk instead of krogstad \\n', 'helmer  this is simply incredible obstinacy  because you chose to give\\nhim a thoughtless promise that you would speak for him  i am expected\\nto  \\n', 'nora  that isn t the reason  torvald  it is for your own sake  this\\nfellow writes in the most scurrilous newspapers  you have told me so\\nyourself  he can do you an unspeakable amount of harm  i am frightened\\nto death of him  \\n', 'helmer  ah  i understand  it is recollections of the past that scare\\nyou \\n', 'nora  what do you mean \\n', 'helmer  naturally you are thinking of your father \\n', 'nora  yes  yes  of course  just recall to your mind what these malicious\\ncreatures wrote in the papers about papa  and how horribly they\\nslandered him  i believe they would have procured his dismissal if the\\ndepartment had not sent you over to inquire into it  and if you had not\\nbeen so kindly disposed and helpful to him \\n', 'helmer  my little nora  there is an important difference between your\\nfather and me  your father s reputation as a public official was not\\nabove suspicion  mine is  and i hope it will continue to be so  as long\\nas i hold my office \\n', 'nora  you never can tell what mischief these men may contrive  we ought\\nto be so well off  so snug and happy here in our peaceful home  and have\\nno cares  you and i and the children  torvald  that is why i beg you so\\nearnestly  \\n', 'helmer  and it is just by interceding for him that you make it\\nimpossible for me to keep him  it is already known at the bank that i\\nmean to dismiss krogstad  is it to get about now that the new manager\\nhas changed his mind at his wife s bidding  \\n', 'nora  and what if it did \\n', 'helmer  of course   if only this obstinate little person can get her\\nway  do you suppose i am going to make myself ridiculous before my whole\\nstaff  to let people think that i am a man to be swayed by all sorts of\\noutside influence  i should very soon feel the consequences of it  i can\\ntell you  and besides  there is one thing that makes it quite impossible\\nfor me to have krogstad in the bank as long as i am manager \\n', 'nora  whatever is that \\n', 'helmer  his moral failings i might perhaps have overlooked  if\\nnecessary  \\n', 'nora  yes  you could  couldn t you \\n', 'helmer  and i hear he is a good worker  too  but i knew him when we\\nwere boys  it was one of those rash friendships that so often prove an\\nincubus in afterlife  i may as well tell you plainly  we were once on\\nvery intimate terms with one another  but this tactless fellow lays no\\nrestraint on himself when other people are present  on the contrary \\nhe thinks it gives him the right to adopt a familiar tone with me  and\\nevery minute it is  i say  helmer  old fellow   and that sort of thing \\ni assure you it is extremely painful for me  he would make my position\\nin the bank intolerable \\n', 'nora  torvald  i don t believe you mean that \\n', 'helmer  don t you  why not \\n', 'nora  because it is such a narrow minded way of looking at things \\n', 'helmer  what are you saying  narrow minded  do you think i am\\nnarrow minded \\n', 'nora  no  just the opposite  dear  and it is exactly for that reason \\n', 'helmer  it s the same thing  you say my point of view is narrow minded \\nso i must be so too  narrow minded  very well  i must put an end to\\nthis   helen \\n', 'nora  what are you going to do \\n', 'helmer   settle it   look here \\ntake this letter and go downstairs with it at once  find a messenger and\\ntell him to deliver it  and be quick  the address is on it  and here is\\nthe money \\n', 'maid  very well  sir  \\n', 'helmer   now then  little miss obstinate \\n', 'nora   torvald  what was that letter \\n', 'helmer  krogstad s dismissal \\n', 'nora  call her back  torvald  there is still time  oh torvald  call her\\nback  do it for my sake  for your own sake  for the children s sake  do\\nyou hear me

in  although\\nreally it is an insult to me  it is  indeed  isn t it an insult to think\\nthat i should be afraid of a starving quill driver s vengeance  but i\\nforgive you nevertheless  because it is such eloquent witness to your\\ngreat love for me   and that is as it should be \\nmy own darling nora  come what will  you may be sure i shall have both\\ncourage and strength if they be needed  you will see i am man enough to\\ntake everything upon myself \\n', 'nora   what do you mean by that \\n', 'helmer  everything  i say  \\n', 'nora   you will never have to do that \\n', 'helmer  that s right  well  we will share it  nora  as man and wife\\nshould  that is how it shall be   are you content now \\nthere  there   not these frightened dove s eyes  the whole thing is only\\nthe wildest

as you\\nplease   and when rank comes  tell him where he\\nwill find me  \\n', 'nora   he was capable of doing it  he will do it  he will do it in\\nspite of everything   no  not that  never  never

mustn t go in to\\ntorvald now  i think he is busy with something \\n', 'rank  and you \\n', 'nora   oh  you know very\\nwell i always have time for you \\n', 'rank  thank you  i shall make use of as much of it as i can \\n', 'nora  what do you mean by that  as much of it as you can \\n', 'rank  well  does that alarm you \\n', 'nora  it was such a strange way of putting it  is anything likely to\\nhappen \\n', 'rank  nothing but what i have long been prepared for  but i certainly\\ndidn t expect it to happen so soon \\n', 'nora   what have you found out  doctor rank \\nyou must tell me \\n', 'rank   it is all up with me  and it can t be\\nhelped \\n', 'nora   is it about yourself \\n', 'rank  who else  it is no use lying to one s self  i am the most wretched\\nof all my patients  mrs  helmer  lately i have been taking stock of my\\ninternal economy  bankrupt  probably within a month i shall lie rotting\\nin the churchyard \\n', 'nora  what an ugly thing to say \\n', 'rank  the thing itself is cursedly ugly  and the worst of it is that i\\nshall have to face so much more that is ugly before that  i shall only\\nmake one more examination of myself  when i have done that  i shall know\\npretty certainly when it will be that the horrors of dissolution will\\nbegin  there is something i want to tell you  helmer s refined nature\\ngives him an unconquerable disgust at everything that is ugly  i won t\\nhave him in my sick room \\n', 'nora  oh  but  doctor rank  \\n', 'rank  i won t have him there  not on any account  i bar my door to him \\nas soon as i am quite certain that the worst has come  i shall send\\nyou my card with a black cross on it  and then you will know that the\\nloathsome end has begun \\n', 'nora  you are quite absurd today  and i wanted you so much to be in a\\nreally good humour \\n', 'rank  with death stalking beside me   to have to pay this penalty for\\nanother man s sin  is there any justice in that  and in every single\\nfamily

to truffles \\n', 'nora  truffles  yes  and oysters too  i suppose \\n', 'rank  oysters  of course  that goes without saying \\n', 'nora  and heaps of port and champagne  it is sad that all these nice\\nthings should take their revenge on our bones \\n', 'rank  especially that they should revenge themselves on the unlucky\\nbones of those who have not had the satisfaction of enjoying them

whom\\none would almost always rather have as companions \\n', 'rank  yes  there is something in that \\n', 'nora  when i was at home  of course i loved papa best  but i always\\nthought it tremendous fun if i could steal down into the maids  room \\nbecause they never moralised at all  and talked to each other about such\\nentertaining things \\n', 'rank  i see  it is their place i have taken \\n', 'nora   oh  dear  nice doctor rank  i never\\nmeant that at all  but surely you can understand that being with torvald\\nis a little like being with papa  \\n', 'maid  if you please  ma am

prevent it  mr  krogstad  i fought as hard as i could\\non your side  but it was no good \\n', 'krogstad  does your husband love you so little  then  he knows what i\\ncan expose you to  and yet he ventures  \\n', 'nora  how can you suppose that he has any knowledge of the sort \\n', 'krogstad  i didn t suppose so at all  it would not be the least like our\\ndear torvald helmer to show so much courage  \\n', 'nora  mr  krogstad  a little respect for my husband  please \\n', 'krogstad  certainly  all the respect he deserves  but since you have\\nkept the matter so carefully to yourself  i make bold to suppose that\\nyou have a little clearer idea  than you had yesterday  of what it\\nactually is that you have done \\n', 'nora  more than you could ever teach me \\n', 'krogstad  yes  such a bad lawyer as i am \\n', 'nora  what is it you want of me \\n', 'krogstad  only to see how you were  mrs  helmer  i have been thinking\\nabout you all day long  a mere cashier  a quill driver  a  well  a man\\nlike me  even he has a little of what is called feeling  you know \\n', 'nora  show it  then  think of my little children \\n', 'krogstad  have you and your husband thought of mine  but never mind\\nabout that  i only wanted to tell you that you need not take this matter\\ntoo seriously  in the first place there will be no accusation made on my\\npart \\n', 'nora  no  of course

to her  mrs  linde  she had danced her tarantella  and\\nit had been a tremendous success  as it deserved  although possibly the\\nperformance was a trifle too realistic  a little more so  i mean  than\\nwas strictly compatible with the limitations of art  but never mind\\nabout that  the chief thing is  she had made a success  she had made\\na tremendous success  do you think i was going to let her remain there\\nafter that  and spoil the effect  no  indeed  i took my charming little\\ncapri maiden  my capricious little capri maiden  i should say  on my\\narm  took one quick turn round the room  a curtsey on either side  and \\nas they say in novels  the beautiful apparition disappeared  an exit\\nought always to be effective  mrs  linde  but that is what i cannot make\\nnora

are\\nsecretly in love  and you are my secretly promised bride  and that no\\none suspects there is anything between us \\n', 'nora  yes  yes  i know very well your thoughts are with me all the time \\n', 'helmer  and when we are leaving  and i am putting the shawl over your\\nbeautiful young shoulders  on your lovely neck  then i imagine that you\\nare my young bride and that we have just come

differed from him i concealed the fact  because he would not\\nhave liked it  he called me his doll child  and he played with me just\\nas i used to play with my dolls  and when i came to live with you  \\n', 'helmer  what sort of an expression is that to use about our marriage \\n', 'nora   i mean that i was simply transferred from papa s\\nhands into yours  you arranged everything according to your own taste \\nand so i got the same tastes as your else i pretended to  i am really\\nnot quite sure which  i think sometimes the one and sometimes the other \\nwhen i look back on it  it seems to me as if i had been living here like\\na poor woman  just from hand to mouth  i have existed merely to perform\\ntricks for you  torvald  but you would have it so  you and papa have\\ncommitted a great sin against me  it is your fault that i have made\\nnothing of my life \\n', 'helmer  how unreasonable and how ungrateful you are  nora  have you not\\nbeen happy here \\n', 'nora  no  i have never been happy  i thought i was  but it has never\\nreally been so \\n', 'helmer  not  not happy \\n', 'nora  no  only merry  and you have always been so kind to me  but our\\nhome has been nothing

they\\nthought it great fun when i played with them  that is what our marriage\\nhas been  torvald \\n', 'helmer  there is some truth in what you say  exaggerated and strained as\\nyour view of it is

that \\n', 'nora  indeed  you were perfectly right  i am not fit for the task \\nthere is another task i must undertake first  i must try and educate\\nmyself  you are not the man to help me in that  i must do that for\\nmyself  and that is why i am going to leave you now \\n', 'helmer   what do you say \\n', 'nora  i must stand quite alone  if i am to understand myself and\\neverything about me  it is for that reason that i cannot remain with you\\nany longer \\n', 'helmer  nora  nora \\n', 'nora  i am going away from here now  at once  i am sure christine will\\ntake me in for the night

will say \\n', 'nora  i cannot consider that at all  i only know that it is necessary\\nfor me \\n', 'helmer  it s shocking  this is how you would neglect your most sacred\\nduties \\n', 'nora  what do you consider my most sacred duties \\n', 'helmer  do i need to tell you that  are they not your duties to your\\nhusband and your children \\n', 'nora  i have other duties just as sacred \\n', 'helmer  that you have not  what duties could those be \\n', 'nora  duties to myself \\n', 'helmer  before all else  you are a wife and a mother \\n', 'nora  i don t believe that any longer  i believe that before all else i\\nam a reasonable human being  just as you are  or  at all events  that\\ni must try and become one  i know quite well  torvald  that most people\\nwould think you right  and that views of that kind are to be found in\\nbooks  but i can no longer content myself with what most people say  or\\nwith what is found in books  i must think over things for myself and get\\nto understand them \\n', 'helmer  can you not understand your place in your own home  have you not\\na reliable guide in such matters as that   have you no religion \\n', 'nora  i am afraid  torvald  i do not exactly know what religion is \\n', 'helmer  what are you saying \\n', 'nora  i know nothing but what the clergyman said  when i went to be\\nconfirmed  he told us that religion was this  and that  and the other \\nwhen i am away from all this  and am alone  i will look into that matter\\ntoo  i will see if what the clergyman said is true  or at all events if\\nit is true for me \\n', 'helmer  this is unheard of in a girl of your age  but if religion cannot\\nlead you aright  let me try and awaken your conscience  i suppose you\\nhave some moral sense  or  answer me  am i to think you have none \\n', 'nora  i assure you  torvald  that is not an easy question to answer  i\\nreally don t know  the thing perplexes me altogether  i only know that\\nyou and i look at it in quite a different light  i am learning  too \\nthat the law is quite another thing from what i supposed  but i find it\\nimpossible to convince myself that the law is right  according to it\\na woman has no right to spare her old dying father  or to save her\\nhusband s life  i can t believe that \\n', 'helmer  you talk like a child  you don t understand the conditions of\\nthe world in which you live

out\\nof your mind \\n', 'nora  i have never felt my mind so clear and certain as tonight \\n', 'helmer  and is it with a clear and certain mind that you forsake your\\nhusband and your children \\n', 'nora  yes  it is \\n', 'helmer  then there is only one possible explanation \\n', 'nora  what is that \\n', 'helmer  you do not love me anymore \\n', 'nora  no  that is just it \\n', 'helmer  nora   and you can say that \\n', 'nora  it gives me great pain  torvald  for you have always been so kind\\nto me  but i cannot help it  i do not love you any more \\n', 'helmer   is that a clear and certain conviction\\ntoo \\n', 'nora  yes  absolutely clear and certain  that is the reason why i will\\nnot stay here any longer \\n', 'helmer  and can you tell me what i have done to forfeit your love \\n', 'nora  yes  indeed i can  it was tonight  when the wonderful thing did\\nnot happen  then i saw you were not the man i had thought you were \\n', 'helmer  explain yourself better  i don t understand you \\n', 'nora  i have waited so patiently for eight years  for  goodness knows \\ni knew very well that wonderful things don t happen every day  then this\\nhorrible misfortune came upon me  and then i felt quite certain that the\\nwonderful thing was going to happen at last  when krogstad s letter was\\nlying out there  never for a moment did i imagine that you would consent\\nto accept this man s conditions  i was so absolutely certain that you\\nwould say to him  publish the thing to the whole world  and when that\\nwas done  \\n', 'helmer  yes  what then   when i had exposed my wife to shame and\\ndisgrace \\n', 'nora  when that was done  i was so absolutely certain  you would come\\nforward and take everything upon yourself  and say  i am the guilty one \\n', 'helmer  nora   \\n', 'nora  you mean that i would never have accepted such a sacrifice on your\\npart  no  of course not  but what would my assurances have been worth\\nagainst yours  that was the wonderful thing which i hoped for and\\nfeared  and it was to prevent that  that i wanted to kill myself \\n', 'helmer  i would gladly work night and day for you  nora  bear sorrow and\\nwant for your

the whole thing\\nwas past  as far as you were concerned it was exactly as if nothing at\\nall had happened  exactly as before  i was your little skylark  your\\ndoll  which you would in future treat with doubly gentle care  because\\nit was so brittle and fragile   torvald  it was then\\nit dawned upon me that for eight years i had been living here with a\\nstrange man  and had borne him three
