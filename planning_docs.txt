Stylometry

What do the statistics look like
Can you predict who said that line?
Style of character vs writer vs translator
Translation issues -- lost in translation
Who is the translator?
Topically, feminism --> gender and writing / speaking style
	- me vs us
	- inclusive vs closed
	- past v present tense
	- and vs or --> logically
		- not
		- think modifiers
	- how, where, when
		- in, of, from
		- these can be made into a broader class
		
Storyline -- that is the writer
	contrast that of the writer / translator
	then get the original norweigen version to see how much is translator

Author, character, translator would all get stylistic markers

Ibsen - A Doll's House
- English vs. Norweigen
- how many lines does nora have?
- temporal aspect (for each of the characters)
	- style changes over time
	- character changes - i.e. of heart
	- can you trace a line / style to particular inportant moments
	- logistic regression -> any given line you can project that onto a number "The Nora Number"
